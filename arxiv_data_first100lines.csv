Survey on Semantic Stereo Matching / Semantic Depth Estimation,"Stereo matching is one of the widely used techniques for inferring depth from
stereo images owing to its robustness and speed. It has become one of the major
topics of research since it finds its applications in autonomous driving,
robotic navigation, 3D reconstruction, and many other fields. Finding pixel
correspondences in non-textured, occluded and reflective areas is the major
challenge in stereo matching. Recent developments have shown that semantic cues
from image segmentation can be used to improve the results of stereo matching.
Many deep neural network architectures have been proposed to leverage the
advantages of semantic segmentation in stereo matching. This paper aims to give
a comparison among the state of art networks both in terms of accuracy and in
terms of speed which are of higher importance in real-time applications."
FUTURE-AI: Guiding Principles and Consensus Recommendations for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Future Medical Imaging,"The recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) combined with the
extensive amount of data generated by today's clinical systems, has led to the
development of imaging AI solutions across the whole value chain of medical
imaging, including image reconstruction, medical image segmentation,
image-based diagnosis and treatment planning. Notwithstanding the successes and
future potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of
the potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are
perceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust
in critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are
currently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI
developments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption.
To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding
principles drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best
practices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These
guiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)
Fairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness
and (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are
further translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying,
developing, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically
trustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice."
Enforcing Mutual Consistency of Hard Regions for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation,"In this paper, we proposed a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) to
effectively exploit the unlabeled hard regions for semi-supervised medical
image segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep
models trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain
and easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g. adhesive
edges or thin branches) for the image segmentation task. Leveraging these
region-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation
model training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists
of two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple
sightly different decoders (i.e. using different up-sampling strategies). The
statistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the
model's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, a new
mutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoder's probability
output and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the
model's uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariant
and low-entropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data, in order
to learn a generalized feature representation. We compared the segmentation
results of the MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on
three public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two common
semi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over
other existing methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation."
Parameter Decoupling Strategy for Semi-supervised 3D Left Atrium Segmentation,"Consistency training has proven to be an advanced semi-supervised framework
and achieved promising results in medical image segmentation tasks through
enforcing an invariance of the predictions over different views of the inputs.
However, with the iterative updating of model parameters, the models would tend
to reach a coupled state and eventually lose the ability to exploit unlabeled
data. To address the issue, we present a novel semi-supervised segmentation
model based on parameter decoupling strategy to encourage consistent
predictions from diverse views. Specifically, we first adopt a two-branch
network to simultaneously produce predictions for each image. During the
training process, we decouple the two prediction branch parameters by quadratic
cosine distance to construct different views in latent space. Based on this,
the feature extractor is constrained to encourage the consistency of
probability maps generated by classifiers under diversified features. In the
overall training process, the parameters of feature extractor and classifiers
are updated alternately by consistency regularization operation and decoupling
operation to gradually improve the generalization performance of the model. Our
method has achieved a competitive result over the state-of-the-art
semi-supervised methods on the Atrial Segmentation Challenge dataset,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework. Code is available at
https://github.com/BX0903/PDC."
Background-Foreground Segmentation for Interior Sensing in Automotive Industry,"To ensure safety in automated driving, the correct perception of the
situation inside the car is as important as its environment. Thus, seat
occupancy detection and classification of detected instances play an important
role in interior sensing. By the knowledge of the seat occupancy status, it is
possible to, e.g., automate the airbag deployment control. Furthermore, the
presence of a driver, which is necessary for partially automated driving cars
at the automation levels two to four can be verified. In this work, we compare
different statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approach
the problem of background-foreground segmentation in camera based interior
sensing. In the recent years, several methods based on different techniques
have been developed and applied to images or videos from different
applications. The peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing is,
that the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well as
dynamic elements. In data considered in this work, even the camera position is
not completely fixed. We review and benchmark three different methods ranging,
i.e., Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Morphological Snakes and a deep neural
network, namely a Mask R-CNN. In particular, the limitations of the classical
methods, GMM and Morphological Snakes, for interior sensing are shown.
Furthermore, it turns, that it is possible to overcome these limitations by
deep learning, e.g.\ using a Mask R-CNN. Although only a small amount of ground
truth data was available for training, we enabled the Mask R-CNN to produce
high quality background-foreground masks via transfer learning. Moreover, we
demonstrate that certain augmentation as well as pre- and post-processing
methods further enhance the performance of the investigated methods."
EdgeFlow: Achieving Practical Interactive Segmentation with Edge-Guided Flow,"High-quality training data play a key role in image segmentation tasks.
Usually, pixel-level annotations are expensive, laborious and time-consuming
for the large volume of training data. To reduce labelling cost and improve
segmentation quality, interactive segmentation methods have been proposed,
which provide the result with just a few clicks. However, their performance
does not meet the requirements of practical segmentation tasks in terms of
speed and accuracy. In this work, we propose EdgeFlow, a novel architecture
that fully utilizes interactive information of user clicks with edge-guided
flow. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without any
post-processing or iterative optimization scheme. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmarks also demonstrate the superiority of our method. In addition, with
the proposed method, we develop an efficient interactive segmentation tool for
practical data annotation tasks. The source code and tool is avaliable at
https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg."
Efficient Hybrid Transformer: Learning Global-local Context for Urban Sence Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation of fine-resolution urban scene images plays a vital
role in extensive practical applications, such as land cover mapping, urban
change detection, environmental protection and economic assessment. Driven by
rapid developments in deep learning technologies, convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) have dominated the semantic segmentation task for many years.
Convolutional neural networks adopt hierarchical feature representation and
have strong local context extraction. However, the local property of the
convolution layer limits the network from capturing global information that is
crucial for improving fine-resolution image segmentation. Recently, Transformer
comprise a hot topic in the computer vision domain. Vision Transformer
demonstrates the great capability of global information modelling, boosting
many vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection and
especially semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid
Transformer (EHT) for semantic segmentation of urban scene images. EHT takes
advantage of CNNs and Transformer, learning global-local context to strengthen
the feature representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EHT has
higher efficiency with competitive accuracy compared with state-of-the-art
benchmark methods. Specifically, the proposed EHT achieves a 67.0% mIoU on the
UAVid test set and outperforms other lightweight models significantly. The code
will be available soon."
Towards to Robust and Generalized Medical Image Segmentation Framework,"To mitigate the radiologist's workload, computer-aided diagnosis with the
capability to review and analyze medical images is gradually deployed. Deep
learning-based region of interest segmentation is among the most exciting use
cases. However, this paradigm is restricted in real-world clinical applications
due to poor robustness and generalization. The issue is more sinister with a
lack of training data. In this paper, we address the challenge from the
representation learning point of view. We investigate that the collapsed
representations, as one of the main reasons which caused poor robustness and
generalization, could be avoided through transfer learning. Therefore, we
propose a novel two-stage framework for robust generalized segmentation. In
particular, an unsupervised Tile-wise AutoEncoder (T-AE) pretraining
architecture is coined to learn meaningful representation for improving the
generalization and robustness of the downstream tasks. Furthermore, the learned
knowledge is transferred to the segmentation benchmark. Coupled with an image
reconstruction network, the representation keeps to be decoded, encouraging the
model to capture more semantic features. Experiments of lung segmentation on
multi chest X-ray datasets are conducted. Empirically, the related experimental
results demonstrate the superior generalization capability of the proposed
framework on unseen domains in terms of high performance and robustness to
corruption, especially under the scenario of the limited training data."
Semi-supervised Meta-learning with Disentanglement for Domain-generalised Medical Image Segmentation,"Generalising deep models to new data from new centres (termed here domains)
remains a challenge. This is largely attributed to shifts in data statistics
(domain shifts) between source and unseen domains. Recently, gradient-based
meta-learning approaches where the training data are split into meta-train and
meta-test sets to simulate and handle the domain shifts during training have
shown improved generalisation performance. However, the current fully
supervised meta-learning approaches are not scalable for medical image
segmentation, where large effort is required to create pixel-wise annotations.
Meanwhile, in a low data regime, the simulated domain shifts may not
approximate the true domain shifts well across source and unseen domains. To
address this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised meta-learning
framework with disentanglement. We explicitly model the representations related
to domain shifts. Disentangling the representations and combining them to
reconstruct the input image allows unlabeled data to be used to better
approximate the true domain shifts for meta-learning. Hence, the model can
achieve better generalisation performance, especially when there is a limited
amount of labeled data. Experiments show that the proposed method is robust on
different segmentation tasks and achieves state-of-the-art generalisation
performance on two public benchmarks."
Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning for Label-efficient Medical Image Segmentation,"The success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation tasks
heavily depends on a large amount of labeled data to supervise the training. On
the other hand, the annotation of biomedical images requires domain knowledge
and can be laborious. Recently, contrastive learning has demonstrated great
potential in learning latent representation of images even without any label.
Existing works have explored its application to biomedical image segmentation
where only a small portion of data is labeled, through a pre-training phase
based on self-supervised contrastive learning without using any labels followed
by a supervised fine-tuning phase on the labeled portion of data only. In this
paper, we establish that by including the limited label in formation in the
pre-training phase, it is possible to boost the performance of contrastive
learning. We propose a supervised local contrastive loss that leverages limited
pixel-wise annotation to force pixels with the same label to gather around in
the embedding space. Such loss needs pixel-wise computation which can be
expensive for large images, and we further propose two strategies, downsampling
and block division, to address the issue. We evaluate our methods on two public
biomedical image datasets of different modalities. With different amounts of
labeled data, our methods consistently outperform the state-of-the-art
contrast-based methods and other semi-supervised learning techniques."
Direct Estimation of Appearance Models for Segmentation,"Image segmentation algorithms often depend on appearance models that
characterize the distribution of pixel values in different image regions. We
describe a new approach for estimating appearance models directly from an
image, without explicit consideration of the pixels that make up each region.
Our approach is based on novel algebraic expressions that relate local image
statistics to the appearance of spatially coherent regions. We describe two
algorithms that can use the aforementioned algebraic expressions to estimate
appearance models directly from an image. The first algorithm solves a system
of linear and quadratic equations using a least squares formulation. The second
algorithm is a spectral method based on an eigenvector computation. We present
experimental results that demonstrate the proposed methods work well in
practice and lead to effective image segmentation algorithms."
MISSFormer: An Effective Medical Image Segmentation Transformer,"The CNN-based methods have achieved impressive results in medical image
segmentation, but it failed to capture the long-range dependencies due to the
inherent locality of convolution operation. Transformer-based methods are
popular in vision tasks recently because of its capacity of long-range
dependencies and get a promising performance. However, it lacks in modeling
local context, although some works attempted to embed convolutional layer to
overcome this problem and achieved some improvement, but it makes the feature
inconsistent and fails to leverage the natural multi-scale features of
hierarchical transformer, which limit the performance of models. In this paper,
taking medical image segmentation as an example, we present MISSFormer, an
effective and powerful Medical Image Segmentation tranSFormer. MISSFormer is a
hierarchical encoder-decoder network and has two appealing designs: 1) A feed
forward network is redesigned with the proposed Enhanced Transformer Block,
which makes features aligned adaptively and enhances the long-range
dependencies and local context. 2) We proposed Enhanced Transformer Context
Bridge, a context bridge with the enhanced transformer block to model the
long-range dependencies and local context of multi-scale features generated by
our hierarchical transformer encoder. Driven by these two designs, the
MISSFormer shows strong capacity to capture more valuable dependencies and
context in medical image segmentation. The experiments on multi-organ and
cardiac segmentation tasks demonstrate the superiority, effectiveness and
robustness of our MISSFormer, the exprimental results of MISSFormer trained
from scratch even outperforms state-of-the-art methods pretrained on ImageNet,
and the core designs can be generalized to other visual segmentation tasks. The
code will be released in Github."
Neural Architecture Search in operational context: a remote sensing case-study,"Deep learning has become in recent years a cornerstone tool fueling key
innovations in the industry, such as autonomous driving. To attain good
performances, the neural network architecture used for a given application must
be chosen with care. These architectures are often handcrafted and therefore
prone to human biases and sub-optimal selection. Neural Architecture Search
(NAS) is a framework introduced to mitigate such risks by jointly optimizing
the network architectures and its weights. Albeit its novelty, it was applied
on complex tasks with significant results - e.g. semantic image segmentation.
In this technical paper, we aim to evaluate its ability to tackle a challenging
operational task: semantic segmentation of objects of interest in satellite
imagery. Designing a NAS framework is not trivial and has strong dependencies
to hardware constraints. We therefore motivate our NAS approach selection and
provide corresponding implementation details. We also present novel ideas to
carry out other such use-case studies."
Patch-based medical image segmentation using Quantum Tensor Networks,"Tensor networks are efficient factorisations of high dimensional tensors into
a network of lower order tensors. They have been most commonly used to model
entanglement in quantum many-body systems and more recently are witnessing
increased applications in supervised machine learning. In this work, we
formulate image segmentation in a supervised setting with tensor networks. The
key idea is to first lift the pixels in image patches to exponentially high
dimensional feature spaces and using a linear decision hyper-plane to classify
the input pixels into foreground and background classes. The high dimensional
linear model itself is approximated using the matrix product state (MPS) tensor
network. The MPS is weight-shared between the non-overlapping image patches
resulting in our strided tensor network model. The performance of the proposed
model is evaluated on three 2D- and one 3D- biomedical imaging datasets. The
performance of the proposed tensor network segmentation model is compared with
relevant baseline methods. In the 2D experiments, the tensor network model
yeilds competitive performance compared to the baseline methods while being
more resource efficient."
Combo Loss: Handling Input and Output Imbalance in Multi-Organ Segmentation,"Simultaneous segmentation of multiple organs from different medical imaging
modalities is a crucial task as it can be utilized for computer-aided
diagnosis, computer-assisted surgery, and therapy planning. Thanks to the
recent advances in deep learning, several deep neural networks for medical
image segmentation have been introduced successfully for this purpose. In this
paper, we focus on learning a deep multi-organ segmentation network that labels
voxels. In particular, we examine the critical choice of a loss function in
order to handle the notorious imbalance problem that plagues both the input and
output of a learning model. The input imbalance refers to the class-imbalance
in the input training samples (i.e., small foreground objects embedded in an
abundance of background voxels, as well as organs of varying sizes). The output
imbalance refers to the imbalance between the false positives and false
negatives of the inference model. In order to tackle both types of imbalance
during training and inference, we introduce a new curriculum learning based
loss function. Specifically, we leverage Dice similarity coefficient to deter
model parameters from being held at bad local minima and at the same time
gradually learn better model parameters by penalizing for false
positives/negatives using a cross entropy term. We evaluated the proposed loss
function on three datasets: whole body positron emission tomography (PET) scans
with 5 target organs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prostate scans, and
ultrasound echocardigraphy images with a single target organ i.e., left
ventricular. We show that a simple network architecture with the proposed
integrative loss function can outperform state-of-the-art methods and results
of the competing methods can be improved when our proposed loss is used."
POPCORN: Progressive Pseudo-labeling with Consistency Regularization and Neighboring,"Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data to compensate for the
scarcity of annotated images and the lack of method generalization to unseen
domains, two usual problems in medical segmentation tasks. In this work, we
propose POPCORN, a novel method combining consistency regularization and
pseudo-labeling designed for image segmentation. The proposed framework uses
high-level regularization to constrain our segmentation model to use similar
latent features for images with similar segmentations. POPCORN estimates a
proximity graph to select data from easiest ones to more difficult ones, in
order to ensure accurate pseudo-labeling and to limit confirmation bias.
Applied to multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation, our method demonstrates
competitive results compared to other state-of-the-art SSL strategies."
HCDG: A Hierarchical Consistency Framework for Domain Generalization on Medical Image Segmentation,"Modern deep neural networks struggle to transfer knowledge and generalize
across domains when deploying to real-world applications. Domain generalization
(DG) aims to learn a universal representation from multiple source domains to
improve the network generalization ability on unseen target domains. Previous
DG methods mostly focus on the data-level consistency scheme to advance the
generalization capability of deep networks, without considering the synergistic
regularization of different consistency schemes. In this paper, we present a
novel Hierarchical Consistency framework for Domain Generalization (HCDG) by
ensembling Extrinsic Consistency and Intrinsic Consistency. Particularly, for
Extrinsic Consistency, we leverage the knowledge across multiple source domains
to enforce data-level consistency. Also, we design a novel Amplitude
Gaussian-mixing strategy for Fourier-based data augmentation to enhance such
consistency. For Intrinsic Consistency, we perform task-level consistency for
the same instance under the dual-task form. We evaluate the proposed HCDG
framework on two medical image segmentation tasks, i.e., optic cup/disc
segmentation on fundus images and prostate MRI segmentation. Extensive
experimental results manifest the effectiveness and versatility of our HCDG
framework. Code will be available once accept."
Pyramid Medical Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation,"Deep neural networks have been a prevailing technique in the field of medical
image processing. However, the most popular convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) based methods for medical image segmentation are imperfect because they
model long-range dependencies by stacking layers or enlarging filters.
Transformers and the self-attention mechanism are recently proposed to
effectively learn long-range dependencies by modeling all pairs of word-to-word
attention regardless of their positions. The idea has also been extended to the
computer vision field by creating and treating image patches as embeddings.
Considering the computation complexity for whole image self-attention, current
transformer-based models settle for a rigid partitioning scheme that
potentially loses informative relations. Besides, current medical transformers
model global context on full resolution images, leading to unnecessary
computation costs. To address these issues, we developed a novel method to
integrate multi-scale attention and CNN feature extraction using a pyramidal
network architecture, namely Pyramid Medical Transformer (PMTrans). The PMTrans
captured multi-range relations by working on multi-resolution images. An
adaptive partitioning scheme was implemented to retain informative relations
and to access different receptive fields efficiently. Experimental results on
three medical image datasets (gland segmentation, MoNuSeg, and HECKTOR
datasets) showed that PMTrans outperformed the latest CNN-based and
transformer-based models for medical image segmentation."
Temporally Coherent Person Matting Trained on Fake-Motion Dataset,"We propose a novel neural-network-based method to perform matting of videos
depicting people that does not require additional user input such as trimaps.
Our architecture achieves temporal stability of the resulting alpha mattes by
using motion-estimation-based smoothing of image-segmentation algorithm
outputs, combined with convolutional-LSTM modules on U-Net skip connections.
  We also propose a fake-motion algorithm that generates training clips for the
video-matting network given photos with ground-truth alpha mattes and
background videos. We apply random motion to photos and their mattes to
simulate movement one would find in real videos and composite the result with
the background clips. It lets us train a deep neural network operating on
videos in an absence of a large annotated video dataset and provides
ground-truth training-clip foreground optical flow for use in loss functions."
MEAL: Manifold Embedding-based Active Learning,"Image segmentation is a common and challenging task in autonomous driving.
Availability of sufficient pixel-level annotations for the training data is a
hurdle. Active learning helps learning from small amounts of data by suggesting
the most promising samples for labeling. In this work, we propose a new
pool-based method for active learning, which proposes promising patches
extracted from full image, in each acquisition step. The problem is framed in
an exploration-exploitation framework by combining an embedding based on
Uniform Manifold Approximation to model representativeness with entropy as
uncertainty measure to model informativeness. We applied our proposed method to
the autonomous driving datasets CamVid and Cityscapes and performed a
quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art baselines. We find that our
active learning method achieves better performance compared to previous
methods."
UCTransNet: Rethinking the Skip Connections in U-Net from a Channel-wise Perspective with Transformer,"Most recent semantic segmentation methods adopt a U-Net framework with an
encoder-decoder architecture. It is still challenging for U-Net with a simple
skip connection scheme to model the global multi-scale context: 1) Not each
skip connection setting is effective due to the issue of incompatible feature
sets of encoder and decoder stage, even some skip connection negatively
influence the segmentation performance; 2) The original U-Net is worse than the
one without any skip connection on some datasets. Based on our findings, we
propose a new segmentation framework, named UCTransNet (with a proposed CTrans
module in U-Net), from the channel perspective with attention mechanism.
Specifically, the CTrans module is an alternate of the U-Net skip connections,
which consists of a sub-module to conduct the multi-scale Channel Cross fusion
with Transformer (named CCT) and a sub-module Channel-wise Cross-Attention
(named CCA) to guide the fused multi-scale channel-wise information to
effectively connect to the decoder features for eliminating the ambiguity.
Hence, the proposed connection consisting of the CCT and CCA is able to replace
the original skip connection to solve the semantic gaps for an accurate
automatic medical image segmentation. The experimental results suggest that our
UCTransNet produces more precise segmentation performance and achieves
consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art for semantic segmentation
across different datasets and conventional architectures involving transformer
or U-shaped framework. Code: https://github.com/McGregorWwww/UCTransNet."
Attention-Based 3D Seismic Fault Segmentation Training by a Few 2D Slice Labels,"Detection faults in seismic data is a crucial step for seismic structural
interpretation, reservoir characterization and well placement. Some recent
works regard it as an image segmentation task. The task of image segmentation
requires huge labels, especially 3D seismic data, which has a complex structure
and lots of noise. Therefore, its annotation requires expert experience and a
huge workload. In this study, we present lambda-BCE and lambda-smooth L1loss to
effectively train 3D-CNN by some slices from 3D seismic data, so that the model
can learn the segmentation of 3D seismic data from a few 2D slices. In order to
fully extract information from limited data and suppress seismic noise, we
propose an attention module that can be used for active supervision training
and embedded in the network. The attention heatmap label is generated by the
original label, and letting it supervise the attention module using the
lambda-smooth L1loss. The experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of our loss
function, the method can extract 3D seismic features from a few 2D slice
labels. And it also shows the advanced performance of the attention module,
which can significantly suppress the noise in the seismic data while increasing
the model's sensitivity to the foreground. Finally, on the public test set, we
only use the 2D slice labels training that accounts for 3.3% of the 3D volume
label, and achieve similar performance to the 3D volume label training."
"A Survey on Machine Learning Techniques for Auto Labeling of Video, Audio, and Text Data","Machine learning has been utilized to perform tasks in many different domains
such as classification, object detection, image segmentation and natural
language analysis. Data labeling has always been one of the most important
tasks in machine learning. However, labeling large amounts of data increases
the monetary cost in machine learning. As a result, researchers started to
focus on reducing data annotation and labeling costs. Transfer learning was
designed and widely used as an efficient approach that can reasonably reduce
the negative impact of limited data, which in turn, reduces the data
preparation cost. Even transferring previous knowledge from a source domain
reduces the amount of data needed in a target domain. However, large amounts of
annotated data are still demanded to build robust models and improve the
prediction accuracy of the model. Therefore, researchers started to pay more
attention on auto annotation and labeling. In this survey paper, we provide a
review of previous techniques that focuses on optimized data annotation and
labeling for video, audio, and text data."
From Contexts to Locality: Ultra-high Resolution Image Segmentation via Locality-aware Contextual Correlation,"Ultra-high resolution image segmentation has raised increasing interests in
recent years due to its realistic applications. In this paper, we innovate the
widely used high-resolution image segmentation pipeline, in which an ultra-high
resolution image is partitioned into regular patches for local segmentation and
then the local results are merged into a high-resolution semantic mask. In
particular, we introduce a novel locality-aware contextual correlation based
segmentation model to process local patches, where the relevance between local
patch and its various contexts are jointly and complementarily utilized to
handle the semantic regions with large variations. Additionally, we present a
contextual semantics refinement network that associates the local segmentation
result with its contextual semantics, and thus is endowed with the ability of
reducing boundary artifacts and refining mask contours during the generation of
final high-resolution mask. Furthermore, in comprehensive experiments, we
demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in public
benchmarks. Our released codes are available at
https://github.com/liqiokkk/FCtL."
"A Critical Connectivity Radius for Segmenting Randomly-Generated, High Dimensional Data Points","Motivated by a $2$-dimensional (unsupervised) image segmentation task whereby
local regions of pixels are clustered via edge detection methods, a more
general probabilistic mathematical framework is devised. Critical thresholds
are calculated that indicate strong correlation between randomly-generated,
high dimensional data points that have been projected into structures in a
partition of a bounded, $2$-dimensional area, of which, an image is a special
case. A neighbor concept for structures in the partition is defined and a
critical radius is uncovered. Measured from a central structure in localized
regions of the partition, the radius indicates strong, long and short range
correlation in the count of occupied structures. The size of a short interval
of radii is estimated upon which the transition from short-to-long range
correlation is virtually assured, which defines a demarcation of when an image
ceases to be ""interesting""."
Personalized Image Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation models trained on public datasets have achieved great
success in recent years. However, these models didn't consider the
personalization issue of segmentation though it is important in practice. In
this paper, we address the problem of personalized image segmentation. The
objective is to generate more accurate segmentation results on unlabeled
personalized images by investigating the data's personalized traits. To open up
future research in this area, we collect a large dataset containing various
users' personalized images called PIS (Personalized Image Semantic
Segmentation). We also survey some recent researches related to this problem
and report their performance on our dataset. Furthermore, by observing the
correlation among a user's personalized images, we propose a baseline method
that incorporates the inter-image context when segmenting certain images.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the existing methods on
the proposed dataset. The code and the PIS dataset will be made publicly
available."
Segmenter: Transformer for Semantic Segmentation,"Image segmentation is often ambiguous at the level of individual image
patches and requires contextual information to reach label consensus. In this
paper we introduce Segmenter, a transformer model for semantic segmentation. In
contrast to convolution-based methods, our approach allows to model global
context already at the first layer and throughout the network. We build on the
recent Vision Transformer (ViT) and extend it to semantic segmentation. To do
so, we rely on the output embeddings corresponding to image patches and obtain
class labels from these embeddings with a point-wise linear decoder or a mask
transformer decoder. We leverage models pre-trained for image classification
and show that we can fine-tune them on moderate sized datasets available for
semantic segmentation. The linear decoder allows to obtain excellent results
already, but the performance can be further improved by a mask transformer
generating class masks. We conduct an extensive ablation study to show the
impact of the different parameters, in particular the performance is better for
large models and small patch sizes. Segmenter attains excellent results for
semantic segmentation. It outperforms the state of the art on both ADE20K and
Pascal Context datasets and is competitive on Cityscapes."
Autonomous Removal of Perspective Distortion of Elevator Button Images based on Corner Detection,"Elevator button recognition is a critical function to realize the autonomous
operation of elevators. However, challenging image conditions and various image
distortions make it difficult to recognize buttons accurately. To fill this
gap, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach, which aims to
autonomously correct perspective distortions of elevator button images based on
button corner detection results. First, we leverage a novel image segmentation
model and the Hough Transform method to obtain button segmentation and button
corner detection results. Then, pixel coordinates of standard button corners
are used as reference features to estimate camera motions for correcting
perspective distortions. Fifteen elevator button images are captured from
different angles of view as the dataset. The experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed approach is capable of estimating camera motions and removing
perspective distortions of elevator button images with high accuracy."
Box-Adapt: Domain-Adaptive Medical Image Segmentation using Bounding BoxSupervision,"Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medicalimage segmentation,
but it usually requires a large numberof images labeled with fine-grained
segmentation masks, andthe annotation of these masks can be very expensive
andtime-consuming. Therefore, recent methods try to use un-supervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods to borrow in-formation from labeled data from other
datasets (source do-mains) to a new dataset (target domain). However, due tothe
absence of labels in the target domain, the performance ofUDA methods is much
worse than that of the fully supervisedmethod. In this paper, we propose a
weakly supervised do-main adaptation setting, in which we can partially label
newdatasets with bounding boxes, which are easier and cheaperto obtain than
segmentation masks. Accordingly, we proposea new weakly-supervised domain
adaptation method calledBox-Adapt, which fully explores the fine-grained
segmenta-tion mask in the source domain and the weak bounding boxin the target
domain. Our Box-Adapt is a two-stage methodthat first performs joint training
on the source and target do-mains, and then conducts self-training with the
pseudo-labelsof the target domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
ourmethod in the liver segmentation task. Weakly supervised do-main adaptation"
ISNet: Integrate Image-Level and Semantic-Level Context for Semantic Segmentation,"Co-occurrent visual pattern makes aggregating contextual information a common
paradigm to enhance the pixel representation for semantic image segmentation.
The existing approaches focus on modeling the context from the perspective of
the whole image, i.e., aggregating the image-level contextual information.
Despite impressive, these methods weaken the significance of the pixel
representations of the same category, i.e., the semantic-level contextual
information. To address this, this paper proposes to augment the pixel
representations by aggregating the image-level and semantic-level contextual
information, respectively. First, an image-level context module is designed to
capture the contextual information for each pixel in the whole image. Second,
we aggregate the representations of the same category for each pixel where the
category regions are learned under the supervision of the ground-truth
segmentation. Third, we compute the similarities between each pixel
representation and the image-level contextual information, the semantic-level
contextual information, respectively. At last, a pixel representation is
augmented by weighted aggregating both the image-level contextual information
and the semantic-level contextual information with the similarities as the
weights. Integrating the image-level and semantic-level context allows this
paper to report state-of-the-art accuracy on four benchmarks, i.e., ADE20K,
LIP, COCOStuff and Cityscapes."
Re-using Adversarial Mask Discriminators for Test-time Training under Distribution Shifts,"Thanks to their ability to learn flexible data-driven losses, Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an integral part of many semi- and
weakly-supervised methods for medical image segmentation. GANs jointly optimise
a generator and an adversarial discriminator on a set of training data. After
training has completed, the discriminator is usually discarded and only the
generator is used for inference. But should we discard discriminators? In this
work, we argue that training stable discriminators produces expressive loss
functions that we can re-use at inference to detect and correct segmentation
mistakes. First, we identify key challenges and suggest possible solutions to
make discriminators re-usable at inference. Then, we show that we can combine
discriminators with image reconstruction costs (via decoders) to further
improve the model. Our method is simple and improves the test-time performance
of pre-trained GANs. Moreover, we show that it is compatible with standard
post-processing techniques and it has potentials to be used for Online
Continual Learning. With our work, we open new research avenues for re-using
adversarial discriminators at inference."
Mining Contextual Information Beyond Image for Semantic Segmentation,"This paper studies the context aggregation problem in semantic image
segmentation. The existing researches focus on improving the pixel
representations by aggregating the contextual information within individual
images. Though impressive, these methods neglect the significance of the
representations of the pixels of the corresponding class beyond the input
image. To address this, this paper proposes to mine the contextual information
beyond individual images to further augment the pixel representations. We first
set up a feature memory module, which is updated dynamically during training,
to store the dataset-level representations of various categories. Then, we
learn class probability distribution of each pixel representation under the
supervision of the ground-truth segmentation. At last, the representation of
each pixel is augmented by aggregating the dataset-level representations based
on the corresponding class probability distribution. Furthermore, by utilizing
the stored dataset-level representations, we also propose a representation
consistent learning strategy to make the classification head better address
intra-class compactness and inter-class dispersion. The proposed method could
be effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks (e.g., FCN,
PSPNet, OCRNet and DeepLabV3) and brings consistent performance improvements.
Mining contextual information beyond image allows us to report state-of-the-art
performance on various benchmarks: ADE20K, LIP, Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff."
Fully Transformer Networks for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Transformers have shown impressive performance in various natural language
processing and computer vision tasks, due to the capability of modeling
long-range dependencies. Recent progress has demonstrated to combine such
transformers with CNN-based semantic image segmentation models is very
promising. However, it is not well studied yet on how well a pure transformer
based approach can achieve for image segmentation. In this work, we explore a
novel framework for semantic image segmentation, which is encoder-decoder based
Fully Transformer Networks (FTN). Specifically, we first propose a Pyramid
Group Transformer (PGT) as the encoder for progressively learning hierarchical
features, while reducing the computation complexity of the standard visual
transformer(ViT). Then, we propose a Feature Pyramid Transformer (FPT) to fuse
semantic-level and spatial-level information from multiple levels of the PGT
encoder for semantic image segmentation. Surprisingly, this simple baseline can
achieve new state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging semantic
segmentation benchmarks, including PASCAL Context, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff. The
source code will be released upon the publication of this work."
PoissonSeg: Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation via Poisson Learning,"The application of deep learning to medical image segmentation has been
hampered due to the lack of abundant pixel-level annotated data. Few-shot
Semantic Segmentation (FSS) is a promising strategy for breaking the deadlock.
However, a high-performing FSS model still requires sufficient pixel-level
annotated classes for training to avoid overfitting, which leads to its
performance bottleneck in medical image segmentation due to the unmet need for
annotations. Thus, semi-supervised FSS for medical images is accordingly
proposed to utilize unlabeled data for further performance improvement.
Nevertheless, existing semi-supervised FSS methods has two obvious defects: (1)
neglecting the relationship between the labeled and unlabeled data; (2) using
unlabeled data directly for end-to-end training leads to degenerated
representation learning. To address these problems, we propose a novel
semi-supervised FSS framework for medical image segmentation. The proposed
framework employs Poisson learning for modeling data relationship and
propagating supervision signals, and Spatial Consistency Calibration for
encouraging the model to learn more coherent representations. In this process,
unlabeled samples do not involve in end-to-end training, but provide
supervisory information for query image segmentation through graph-based
learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three medical image segmentation
datasets (i.e. ISIC skin lesion segmentation, abdominal organs segmentation for
MRI and abdominal organs segmentation for CT) to demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance and broad applicability of the proposed framework."
Deep Reinforcement Learning in Computer Vision: A Comprehensive Survey,"Deep reinforcement learning augments the reinforcement learning framework and
utilizes the powerful representation of deep neural networks. Recent works have
demonstrated the remarkable successes of deep reinforcement learning in various
domains including finance, medicine, healthcare, video games, robotics, and
computer vision. In this work, we provide a detailed review of recent and
state-of-the-art research advances of deep reinforcement learning in computer
vision. We start with comprehending the theories of deep learning,
reinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning. We then propose a
categorization of deep reinforcement learning methodologies and discuss their
advantages and limitations. In particular, we divide deep reinforcement
learning into seven main categories according to their applications in computer
vision, i.e. (i)landmark localization (ii) object detection; (iii) object
tracking; (iv) registration on both 2D image and 3D image volumetric data (v)
image segmentation; (vi) videos analysis; and (vii) other applications. Each of
these categories is further analyzed with reinforcement learning techniques,
network design, and performance. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis
of the existing publicly available datasets and examine source code
availability. Finally, we present some open issues and discuss future research
directions on deep reinforcement learning in computer vision"
Duo-SegNet: Adversarial Dual-Views for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation,"Segmentation of images is a long-standing challenge in medical AI. This is
mainly due to the fact that training a neural network to perform image
segmentation requires a significant number of pixel-level annotated data, which
is often unavailable. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised image
segmentation technique based on the concept of multi-view learning. In contrast
to the previous art, we introduce an adversarial form of dual-view training and
employ a critic to formulate the learning problem in multi-view training as a
min-max problem. Thorough quantitative and qualitative evaluations on several
datasets indicate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art medical
image segmentation algorithms consistently and comfortably. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/himashi92/Duo-SegNet"
Comprehensive Multi-Modal Interactions for Referring Image Segmentation,"We investigate Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which outputs a
segmentation map corresponding to the given natural language description. To
solve RIS efficiently, we need to understand each word's relationship with
other words, each region in the image to other regions, and cross-modal
alignment between linguistic and visual domains. We argue that one of the
limiting factors in the recent methods is that they do not handle these
interactions simultaneously. To this end, we propose a novel architecture
called JRNet, which uses a Joint Reasoning Module(JRM) to concurrently capture
the inter-modal and intra-modal interactions. The output of JRM is passed
through a novel Cross-Modal Multi-Level Fusion (CMMLF) module which further
refines the segmentation masks by exchanging contextual information across
visual hierarchy through linguistic features acting as a bridge. We present
thorough ablation studies and validate our approach's performance on four
benchmark datasets, showing considerable performance gains over the existing
state-of-the-art methods."
Self-Paced Contrastive Learning for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Meta-labels,"Pre-training a recognition model with contrastive learning on a large dataset
of unlabeled data has shown great potential to boost the performance of a
downstream task, e.g., image classification. However, in domains such as
medical imaging, collecting unlabeled data can be challenging and expensive. In
this work, we propose to adapt contrastive learning to work with meta-label
annotations, for improving the model's performance in medical image
segmentation even when no additional unlabeled data is available. Meta-labels
such as the location of a 2D slice in a 3D MRI scan or the type of device used,
often come for free during the acquisition process. We use the meta-labels for
pre-training the image encoder as well as to regularize a semi-supervised
training, in which a reduced set of annotated data is used for training.
Finally, to fully exploit the weak annotations, a self-paced learning approach
is used to help the learning and discriminate useful labels from noise. Results
on three different medical image segmentation datasets show that our approach:
i) highly boosts the performance of a model trained on a few scans, ii)
outperforms previous contrastive and semi-supervised approaches, and iii)
reaches close to the performance of a model trained on the full data."
Multi-task Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Pancreas Segmentation,"Federated learning (FL) for medical image segmentation becomes more
challenging in multi-task settings where clients might have different
categories of labels represented in their data. For example, one client might
have patient data with ""healthy'' pancreases only while datasets from other
clients may contain cases with pancreatic tumors. The vanilla federated
averaging algorithm makes it possible to obtain more generalizable deep
learning-based segmentation models representing the training data from multiple
institutions without centralizing datasets. However, it might be sub-optimal
for the aforementioned multi-task scenarios. In this paper, we investigate
heterogeneous optimization methods that show improvements for the automated
segmentation of pancreas and pancreatic tumors in abdominal CT images with FL
settings."
Membership Inference Attacks are Easier on Difficult Problems,"Membership inference attacks (MIA) try to detect if data samples were used to
train a neural network model, e.g. to detect copyright abuses. We show that
models with higher dimensional input and output are more vulnerable to MIA, and
address in more detail models for image translation and semantic segmentation,
including medical image segmentation. We show that reconstruction-errors can
lead to very effective MIA attacks as they are indicative of memorization.
Unfortunately, reconstruction error alone is less effective at discriminating
between non-predictable images used in training and easy to predict images that
were never seen before. To overcome this, we propose using a novel
predictability error that can be computed for each sample, and its computation
does not require a training set. Our membership error, obtained by subtracting
the predictability error from the reconstruction error, is shown to achieve
high MIA accuracy on an extensive number of benchmarks."
Cross-Image Region Mining with Region Prototypical Network for Weakly Supervised Segmentation,"Weakly supervised image segmentation trained with image-level labels usually
suffers from inaccurate coverage of object areas during the generation of the
pseudo groundtruth. This is because the object activation maps are trained with
the classification objective and lack the ability to generalize. To improve the
generality of the objective activation maps, we propose a region prototypical
network RPNet to explore the cross-image object diversity of the training set.
Similar object parts across images are identified via region feature
comparison. Object confidence is propagated between regions to discover new
object areas while background regions are suppressed. Experiments show that the
proposed method generates more complete and accurate pseudo object masks, while
achieving state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO. In
addition, we investigate the robustness of the proposed method on reduced
training sets."
SimCVD: Simple Contrastive Voxel-Wise Representation Distillation for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation,"Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that
requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing
learning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated
medical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust
medical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised
approaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts,
and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic
information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we
present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly
advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe
an unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and
predicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive
objective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach
works surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully
supervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can
be viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust
to representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation
by distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular
datasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT
dataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of
labeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of
90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to
previous best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion,
showing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream
tasks, such as medical image synthesis and registration."
Multi-Slice Dense-Sparse Learning for Efficient Liver and Tumor Segmentation,"Accurate automatic liver and tumor segmentation plays a vital role in
treatment planning and disease monitoring. Recently, deep convolutional neural
network (DCNNs) has obtained tremendous success in 2D and 3D medical image
segmentation. However, 2D DCNNs cannot fully leverage the inter-slice
information, while 3D DCNNs are computationally expensive and memory intensive.
To address these issues, we first propose a novel dense-sparse training flow
from a data perspective, in which, densely adjacent slices and sparsely
adjacent slices are extracted as inputs for regularizing DCNNs, thereby
improving the model performance. Moreover, we design a 2.5D light-weight
nnU-Net from a network perspective, in which, depthwise separable convolutions
are adopted to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on the LiTS
dataset have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method."
Real-Time Multi-Modal Semantic Fusion on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multiple complementary sensors
have tremendous potential for fast autonomous or remote-controlled semantic
scene analysis, e.g., for disaster examination. In this work, we propose a UAV
system for real-time semantic inference and fusion of multiple sensor
modalities. Semantic segmentation of LiDAR scans and RGB images, as well as
object detection on RGB and thermal images, run online onboard the UAV computer
using lightweight CNN architectures and embedded inference accelerators. We
follow a late fusion approach where semantic information from multiple
modalities augments 3D point clouds and image segmentation masks while also
generating an allocentric semantic map. Our system provides augmented semantic
images and point clouds with $\approx\,$9$\,$Hz. We evaluate the integrated
system in real-world experiments in an urban environment."
Hierarchical Random Walker Segmentation for Large Volumetric Biomedical Images,"The random walker method for image segmentation is a popular tool for
semi-automatic image segmentation, especially in the biomedical field. However,
its linear asymptotic run time and memory requirements make application to 3D
datasets of increasing sizes impractical. We propose a hierarchical framework
that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to overcome these
restrictions for the random walker algorithm and achieves sublinear run time
and constant memory complexity. The goal of this framework is -- rather than
improving the segmentation quality compared to the baseline method -- to make
interactive segmentation on out-of-core datasets possible. The method is
evaluated quantitavely on synthetic data and the CT-ORG dataset where the
expected improvements in algorithm run time while maintaining high segmentation
quality are confirmed. The incremental (i.e., interaction update) run time is
demonstrated to be in seconds on a standard PC even for volumes of hundreds of
Gigabytes in size. In a small case study the applicability to large real world
from current biomedical research is demonstrated. An implementation of the
presented method is publicly available in version 5.2 of the widely used volume
rendering and processing software Voreen (https://www.uni-muenster.de/Voreen/)."
Few-Shot Segmentation with Global and Local Contrastive Learning,"In this work, we address the challenging task of few-shot segmentation.
Previous few-shot segmentation methods mainly employ the information of support
images as guidance for query image segmentation. Although some works propose to
build cross-reference between support and query images, their extraction of
query information still depends on the support images. We here propose to
extract the information from the query itself independently to benefit the
few-shot segmentation task. To this end, we first propose a prior extractor to
learn the query information from the unlabeled images with our proposed
global-local contrastive learning. Then, we extract a set of predetermined
priors via this prior extractor. With the obtained priors, we generate the
prior region maps for query images, which locate the objects, as guidance to
perform cross interaction with support features. In such a way, the extraction
of query information is detached from the support branch, overcoming the
limitation by support, and could obtain more informative query clues to achieve
better interaction. Without bells and whistles, the proposed approach achieves
new state-of-the-art performance for the few-shot segmentation task on
PASCAL-5$^{i}$ and COCO datasets."
AASeg: Attention Aware Network for Real Time Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we present a new network named Attention Aware Network (AASeg)
for real time semantic image segmentation. Our network incorporates spatial and
channel information using Spatial Attention (SA) and Channel Attention (CA)
modules respectively. It also uses dense local multi-scale context information
using Multi Scale Context (MSC) module. The feature maps are concatenated
individually to produce the final segmentation map. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method using a comprehensive analysis, quantitative
experimental results and ablation study using Cityscapes, ADE20K and Camvid
datasets. Our network performs better than most previous architectures with a
74.4\% Mean IOU on Cityscapes test dataset while running at 202.7 FPS."
Medical image segmentation with imperfect 3D bounding boxes,"The development of high quality medical image segmentation algorithms depends
on the availability of large datasets with pixel-level labels. The challenges
of collecting such datasets, especially in case of 3D volumes, motivate to
develop approaches that can learn from other types of labels that are cheap to
obtain, e.g. bounding boxes. We focus on 3D medical images with their
corresponding 3D bounding boxes which are considered as series of per-slice
non-tight 2D bounding boxes. While current weakly-supervised approaches that
use 2D bounding boxes as weak labels can be applied to medical image
segmentation, we show that their success is limited in cases when the
assumption about the tightness of the bounding boxes breaks. We propose a new
bounding box correction framework which is trained on a small set of
pixel-level annotations to improve the tightness of a larger set of non-tight
bounding box annotations. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated by
evaluating a known weakly-supervised segmentation approach with and without the
proposed bounding box correction algorithm. When the tightness is improved by
our solution, the results of the weakly-supervised segmentation become much
closer to those of the fully-supervised one."
Contrastive Semi-Supervised Learning for 2D Medical Image Segmentation,"Contrastive Learning (CL) is a recent representation learning approach, which
encourages inter-class separability and intra-class compactness in learned
image representations. Since medical images often contain multiple semantic
classes in an image, using CL to learn representations of local features (as
opposed to global) is important. In this work, we present a novel
semi-supervised 2D medical segmentation solution that applies CL on image
patches, instead of full images. These patches are meaningfully constructed
using the semantic information of different classes obtained via pseudo
labeling. We also propose a novel consistency regularization (CR) scheme, which
works in synergy with CL. It addresses the problem of confirmation bias, and
encourages better clustering in the feature space. We evaluate our method on
four public medical segmentation datasets and a novel histopathology dataset
that we introduce. Our method obtains consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation approaches for all datasets."
Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Image Segmentation,"Domain adaptation (DA) has drawn high interest for its capacity to adapt a
model trained on labeled source data to perform well on unlabeled or weakly
labeled target data from a different domain. Most common DA techniques require
concurrent access to the input images of both the source and target domains.
However, in practice, privacy concerns often impede the availability of source
images in the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in medical
imaging, where, for instance, the source and target images could come from
different clinical sites. We introduce a source-free domain adaptation for
image segmentation. Our formulation is based on minimizing a label-free entropy
loss defined over target-domain data, which we further guide with a
domain-invariant prior on the segmentation regions. Many priors can be derived
from anatomical information. Here, a class ratio prior is estimated from
anatomical knowledge and integrated in the form of a Kullback Leibler (KL)
divergence in our overall loss function. Furthermore, we motivate our overall
loss with an interesting link to maximizing the mutual information between the
target images and their label predictions. We show the effectiveness of our
prior aware entropy minimization in a variety of domain-adaptation scenarios,
with different modalities and applications, including spine, prostate, and
cardiac segmentation. Our method yields comparable results to several state of
the art adaptation techniques, despite having access to much less information,
as the source images are entirely absent in our adaptation phase. Our
straightforward adaptation strategy uses only one network, contrary to popular
adversarial techniques, which are not applicable to a source-free DA setting.
Our framework can be readily used in a breadth of segmentation problems, and
our code is publicly available: https://github.com/mathilde-b/SFDA"
Efficient and Generic Interactive Segmentation Framework to Correct Mispredictions during Clinical Evaluation of Medical Images,"Semantic segmentation of medical images is an essential first step in
computer-aided diagnosis systems for many applications. However, given many
disparate imaging modalities and inherent variations in the patient data, it is
difficult to consistently achieve high accuracy using modern deep neural
networks (DNNs). This has led researchers to propose interactive image
segmentation techniques where a medical expert can interactively correct the
output of a DNN to the desired accuracy. However, these techniques often need
separate training data with the associated human interactions, and do not
generalize to various diseases, and types of medical images. In this paper, we
suggest a novel conditional inference technique for DNNs which takes the
intervention by a medical expert as test time constraints and performs
inference conditioned upon these constraints. Our technique is generic can be
used for medical images from any modality. Unlike other methods, our approach
can correct multiple structures simultaneously and add structures missed at
initial segmentation. We report an improvement of 13.3, 12.5, 17.8, 10.2, and
12.4 times in user annotation time than full human annotation for the nucleus,
multiple cells, liver and tumor, organ, and brain segmentation respectively. We
report a time saving of 2.8, 3.0, 1.9, 4.4, and 8.6 fold compared to other
interactive segmentation techniques. Our method can be useful to clinicians for
diagnosis and post-surgical follow-up with minimal intervention from the
medical expert. The source-code and the detailed results are available here
[1]."
Hidden Markov Modeling for Maximum Likelihood Neuron Reconstruction,"Recent advances in brain clearing and imaging have made it possible to image
entire mammalian brains at sub-micron resolution. These images offer the
potential to assemble brain-wide atlases of projection neuron morphology, but
manual neuron reconstruction remains a bottleneck. In this paper we present a
probabilistic method which combines a hidden Markov state process that encodes
neuron geometric properties with a random field appearance model of the
flourescence process. Our method utilizes dynamic programming to efficiently
compute the global maximizers of what we call the ""most probable"" neuron path.
We applied our algorithm to the output of image segmentation models where false
negatives severed neuronal processes, and showed that it can follow axons in
the presence of noise or nearby neurons. Our method has the potential to be
integrated into a semi or fully automated reconstruction pipeline.
Additionally, it creates a framework for conditioning the probability to fixed
start and endpoints through which users can intervene with hard constraints to,
for example, rule out certain reconstructions, or assign axons to particular
cell bodies."
Improving Aleatoric Uncertainty Quantification in Multi-Annotated Medical Image Segmentation with Normalizing Flows,"Quantifying uncertainty in medical image segmentation applications is
essential, as it is often connected to vital decision-making. Compelling
attempts have been made in quantifying the uncertainty in image segmentation
architectures, e.g. to learn a density segmentation model conditioned on the
input image. Typical work in this field restricts these learnt densities to be
strictly Gaussian. In this paper, we propose to use a more flexible approach by
introducing Normalizing Flows (NFs), which enables the learnt densities to be
more complex and facilitate more accurate modeling for uncertainty. We prove
this hypothesis by adopting the Probabilistic U-Net and augmenting the
posterior density with an NF, allowing it to be more expressive. Our
qualitative as well as quantitative (GED and IoU) evaluations on the
multi-annotated and single-annotated LIDC-IDRI and Kvasir-SEG segmentation
datasets, respectively, show a clear improvement. This is mostly apparent in
the quantification of aleatoric uncertainty and the increased predictive
performance of up to 14 percent. This result strongly indicates that a more
flexible density model should be seriously considered in architectures that
attempt to capture segmentation ambiguity through density modeling. The benefit
of this improved modeling will increase human confidence in annotation and
segmentation, and enable eager adoption of the technology in practice."
Shape Modeling with Spline Partitions,"Shape modelling (with methods that output shapes) is a new and important task
in Bayesian nonparametrics and bioinformatics. In this work, we focus on
Bayesian nonparametric methods for capturing shapes by partitioning a space
using curves. In related work, the classical Mondrian process is used to
partition spaces recursively with axis-aligned cuts, and is widely applied in
multi-dimensional and relational data. The Mondrian process outputs
hyper-rectangles. Recently, the random tessellation process was introduced as a
generalization of the Mondrian process, partitioning a domain with non-axis
aligned cuts in an arbitrary dimensional space, and outputting polytopes.
Motivated by these processes, in this work, we propose a novel parallelized
Bayesian nonparametric approach to partition a domain with curves, enabling
complex data-shapes to be acquired. We apply our method to HIV-1-infected human
macrophage image dataset, and also simulated datasets sets to illustrate our
approach. We compare to support vector machines, random forests and
state-of-the-art computer vision methods such as simple linear iterative
clustering super pixel image segmentation. We develop an R package that is
available at
\url{https://github.com/ShufeiGe/Shape-Modeling-with-Spline-Partitions}."
"Distribution-Free, Risk-Controlling Prediction Sets","While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in
recent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making.
Deploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating
and communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise
uncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued
predictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future
test points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit
finite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate
the size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple,
distribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it
in five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems
where some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label
classification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3)
classification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4)
image segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an
object of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss
extensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and
distributionally robust learning."
Recurrent Mask Refinement for Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation,"Although having achieved great success in medical image segmentation, deep
convolutional neural networks usually require a large dataset with manual
annotations for training and are difficult to generalize to unseen classes.
Few-shot learning has the potential to address these challenges by learning new
classes from only a few labeled examples. In this work, we propose a new
framework for few-shot medical image segmentation based on prototypical
networks. Our innovation lies in the design of two key modules: 1) a context
relation encoder (CRE) that uses correlation to capture local relation features
between foreground and background regions; and 2) a recurrent mask refinement
module that repeatedly uses the CRE and a prototypical network to recapture the
change of context relationship and refine the segmentation mask iteratively.
Experiments on two abdomen CT datasets and an abdomen MRI dataset show the
proposed method obtains substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art
methods by an average of 16.32%, 8.45% and 6.24% in terms of DSC, respectively.
Code is publicly available."
Transductive image segmentation: Self-training and effect of uncertainty estimation,"Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data during training to learn
better models. Previous studies on SSL for medical image segmentation focused
mostly on improving model generalization to unseen data. In some applications,
however, our primary interest is not generalization but to obtain optimal
predictions on a specific unlabeled database that is fully available during
model development. Examples include population studies for extracting imaging
phenotypes. This work investigates an often overlooked aspect of SSL,
transduction. It focuses on the quality of predictions made on the unlabeled
data of interest when they are included for optimization during training,
rather than improving generalization. We focus on the self-training framework
and explore its potential for transduction. We analyze it through the lens of
Information Gain and reveal that learning benefits from the use of calibrated
or under-confident models. Our extensive experiments on a large MRI database
for multi-class segmentation of traumatic brain lesions shows promising results
when comparing transductive with inductive predictions. We believe this study
will inspire further research on transductive learning, a well-suited paradigm
for medical image analysis."
Visual Boundary Knowledge Translation for Foreground Segmentation,"When confronted with objects of unknown types in an image, humans can
effortlessly and precisely tell their visual boundaries. This recognition
mechanism and underlying generalization capability seem to contrast to
state-of-the-art image segmentation networks that rely on large-scale
category-aware annotated training samples. In this paper, we make an attempt
towards building models that explicitly account for visual boundary knowledge,
in hope to reduce the training effort on segmenting unseen categories.
Specifically, we investigate a new task termed as Boundary Knowledge
Translation (BKT). Given a set of fully labeled categories, BKT aims to
translate the visual boundary knowledge learned from the labeled categories, to
a set of novel categories, each of which is provided only a few labeled
samples. To this end, we propose a Translation Segmentation Network
(Trans-Net), which comprises a segmentation network and two boundary
discriminators. The segmentation network, combined with a boundary-aware
self-supervised mechanism, is devised to conduct foreground segmentation, while
the two discriminators work together in an adversarial manner to ensure an
accurate segmentation of the novel categories under light supervision.
Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with only tens of labeled samples as
guidance, Trans-Net achieves close results on par with fully supervised
methods."
OPFython: A Python-Inspired Optimum-Path Forest Classifier,"Machine learning techniques have been paramount throughout the last years,
being applied in a wide range of tasks, such as classification, object
recognition, person identification, and image segmentation. Nevertheless,
conventional classification algorithms, e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision
Trees, and Bayesian classifiers, might lack complexity and diversity, not
suitable when dealing with real-world data. A recent graph-inspired classifier,
known as the Optimum-Path Forest, has proven to be a state-of-the-art
technique, comparable to Support Vector Machines and even surpassing it in some
tasks. This paper proposes a Python-based Optimum-Path Forest framework,
denoted as OPFython, where all of its functions and classes are based upon the
original C language implementation. Additionally, as OPFython is a Python-based
library, it provides a more friendly environment and a faster prototyping
workspace than the C language."
"Iterative, Deep, and Unsupervised Synthetic Aperture Sonar Image Segmentation","Deep learning has not been routinely employed for semantic segmentation of
seabed environment for synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imagery due to the
implicit need of abundant training data such methods necessitate. Abundant
training data, specifically pixel-level labels for all images, is usually not
available for SAS imagery due to the complex logistics (e.g., diver survey,
chase boat, precision position information) needed for obtaining accurate
ground-truth. Many hand-crafted feature based algorithms have been proposed to
segment SAS in an unsupervised fashion. However, there is still room for
improvement as the feature extraction step of these methods is fixed. In this
work, we present a new iterative unsupervised algorithm for learning deep
features for SAS image segmentation. Our proposed algorithm alternates between
clustering superpixels and updating the parameters of a convolutional neural
network (CNN) so that the feature extraction for image segmentation can be
optimized. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a realistic benchmark
dataset. Our results show that the performance of our proposed method is
considerably better than current state-of-the-art methods in SAS image
segmentation."
Open-World Entity Segmentation,"We introduce a new image segmentation task, termed Entity Segmentation (ES)
with the aim to segment all visual entities in an image without considering
semantic category labels. It has many practical applications in image
manipulation/editing where the segmentation mask quality is typically crucial
but category labels are less important. In this setting, all
semantically-meaningful segments are equally treated as categoryless entities
and there is no thing-stuff distinction. Based on our unified entity
representation, we propose a center-based entity segmentation framework with
two novel modules to improve mask quality. Experimentally, both our new task
and framework demonstrate superior advantages as against existing work. In
particular, ES enables the following: (1) merging multiple datasets to form a
large training set without the need to resolve label conflicts; (2) any model
trained on one dataset can generalize exceptionally well to other datasets with
unseen domains. Our code is made publicly available at
https://github.com/dvlab-research/Entity."
Mapping Vulnerable Populations with AI,"Humanitarian actions require accurate information to efficiently delegate
support operations. Such information can be maps of building footprints,
building functions, and population densities. While the access to this
information is comparably easy in industrialized countries thanks to reliable
census data and national geo-data infrastructures, this is not the case for
developing countries, where that data is often incomplete or outdated. Building
maps derived from remote sensing images may partially remedy this challenge in
such countries, but are not always accurate due to different landscape
configurations and lack of validation data. Even when they exist, building
footprint layers usually do not reveal more fine-grained building properties,
such as the number of stories or the building's function (e.g., office,
residential, school, etc.). In this project we aim to automate building
footprint and function mapping using heterogeneous data sources. In a first
step, we intend to delineate buildings from satellite data, using deep learning
models for semantic image segmentation. Building functions shall be retrieved
by parsing social media data like for instance tweets, as well as ground-based
imagery, to automatically identify different buildings functions and retrieve
further information such as the number of building stories. Building maps
augmented with those additional attributes make it possible to derive more
accurate population density maps, needed to support the targeted provision of
humanitarian aid."
"Comprehensive Validation of Automated Whole Body Skeletal Muscle, Adipose Tissue, and Bone Segmentation from 3D CT images for Body Composition Analysis: Towards Extended Body Composition","The latest advances in computer-assisted precision medicine are making it
feasible to move from population-wide models that are useful to discover
aggregate patterns that hold for group-based analysis to patient-specific
models that can drive patient-specific decisions with regard to treatment
choices, and predictions of outcomes of treatment. Body Composition is
recognized as an important driver and risk factor for a wide variety of
diseases, as well as a predictor of individual patient-specific clinical
outcomes to treatment choices or surgical interventions. 3D CT images are
routinely acquired in the oncological worklows and deliver accurate rendering
of internal anatomy and therefore can be used opportunistically to assess the
amount of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue compartments. Powerful tools of
artificial intelligence such as deep learning are making it feasible now to
segment the entire 3D image and generate accurate measurements of all internal
anatomy. These will enable the overcoming of the severe bottleneck that existed
previously, namely, the need for manual segmentation, which was prohibitive to
scale to the hundreds of 2D axial slices that made up a 3D volumetric image.
Automated tools such as presented here will now enable harvesting whole-body
measurements from 3D CT or MRI images, leading to a new era of discovery of the
drivers of various diseases based on individual tissue, organ volume, shape,
and functional status. These measurements were hitherto unavailable thereby
limiting the field to a very small and limited subset. These discoveries and
the potential to perform individual image segmentation with high speed and
accuracy are likely to lead to the incorporation of these 3D measures into
individual specific treatment planning models related to nutrition, aging,
chemotoxicity, surgery and survival after the onset of a major disease such as
cancer."
Segmentation in Style: Unsupervised Semantic Image Segmentation with Stylegan and CLIP,"We introduce a method that allows to automatically segment images into
semantically meaningful regions without human supervision. Derived regions are
consistent across different images and coincide with human-defined semantic
classes on some datasets. In cases where semantic regions might be hard for
human to define and consistently label, our method is still able to find
meaningful and consistent semantic classes. In our work, we use pretrained
StyleGAN2~\cite{karras2020analyzing} generative model: clustering in the
feature space of the generative model allows to discover semantic classes. Once
classes are discovered, a synthetic dataset with generated images and
corresponding segmentation masks can be created. After that a segmentation
model is trained on the synthetic dataset and is able to generalize to real
images. Additionally, by using CLIP~\cite{radford2021learning} we are able to
use prompts defined in a natural language to discover some desired semantic
classes. We test our method on publicly available datasets and show
state-of-the-art results."
Crosslink-Net: Double-branch Encoder Segmentation Network via Fusing Vertical and Horizontal Convolutions,"Accurate image segmentation plays a crucial role in medical image analysis,
yet it faces great challenges of various shapes, diverse sizes, and blurry
boundaries. To address these difficulties, square kernel-based encoder-decoder
architecture has been proposed and widely used, but its performance remains
still unsatisfactory. To further cope with these challenges, we present a novel
double-branch encoder architecture. Our architecture is inspired by two
observations: 1) Since the discrimination of features learned via square
convolutional kernels needs to be further improved, we propose to utilize
non-square vertical and horizontal convolutional kernels in the double-branch
encoder, so features learned by the two branches can be expected to complement
each other. 2) Considering that spatial attention can help models to better
focus on the target region in a large-sized image, we develop an attention loss
to further emphasize the segmentation on small-sized targets. Together, the
above two schemes give rise to a novel double-branch encoder segmentation
framework for medical image segmentation, namely Crosslink-Net. The experiments
validate the effectiveness of our model on four datasets. The code is released
at https://github.com/Qianyu1226/Crosslink-Net."
Reservoir Computing Approach for Gray Images Segmentation,"The paper proposes a novel approach for gray scale images segmentation. It is
based on multiple features extraction from single feature per image pixel,
namely its intensity value, using Echo state network. The newly extracted
features -- reservoir equilibrium states -- reveal hidden image characteristics
that improve its segmentation via a clustering algorithm. Moreover, it was
demonstrated that the intrinsic plasticity tuning of reservoir fits its
equilibrium states to the original image intensity distribution thus allowing
for its better segmentation. The proposed approach is tested on the benchmark
image Lena."
Superpixel-guided Iterative Learning from Noisy Labels for Medical Image Segmentation,"Learning segmentation from noisy labels is an important task for medical
image analysis due to the difficulty in acquiring highquality annotations. Most
existing methods neglect the pixel correlation and structural prior in
segmentation, often producing noisy predictions around object boundaries. To
address this, we adopt a superpixel representation and develop a robust
iterative learning strategy that combines noise-aware training of segmentation
network and noisy label refinement, both guided by the superpixels. This design
enables us to exploit the structural constraints in segmentation labels and
effectively mitigate the impact of label noise in learning. Experiments on two
benchmarks show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches,
and achieves superior robustness in a wide range of label noises. Code is
available at https://github.com/gaozhitong/SP_guided_Noisy_Label_Seg."
Weighted Intersection over Union (wIoU): A New Evaluation Metric for Image Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation metric for performance
evaluation of semantic segmentation. In recent years, many studies have tried
to train pixel-level classifiers on large-scale image datasets to perform
accurate semantic segmentation. The goal of semantic segmentation is to assign
a class label of each pixel in the scene. It has various potential applications
in computer vision fields e.g., object detection, classification, scene
understanding and Etc. To validate the proposed wIoU evaluation metric, we
tested state-of-the art methods on public benchmark datasets (e.g., KITTI)
based on the proposed wIoU metric and compared with other conventional
evaluation metrics."
Vessel-CAPTCHA: an efficient learning framework for vessel annotation and segmentation,"Deep learning techniques for 3D brain vessel image segmentation have not been
as successful as in the segmentation of other organs and tissues. This can be
explained by two factors. First, deep learning techniques tend to show poor
performances at the segmentation of relatively small objects compared to the
size of the full image. Second, due to the complexity of vascular trees and the
small size of vessels, it is challenging to obtain the amount of annotated
training data typically needed by deep learning methods. To address these
problems, we propose a novel annotation-efficient deep learning vessel
segmentation framework. The framework avoids pixel-wise annotations, only
requiring weak patch-level labels to discriminate between vessel and non-vessel
2D patches in the training set, in a setup similar to the CAPTCHAs used to
differentiate humans from bots in web applications. The user-provided weak
annotations are used for two tasks: 1) to synthesize pixel-wise pseudo-labels
for vessels and background in each patch, which are used to train a
segmentation network, and 2) to train a classifier network. The classifier
network allows to generate additional weak patch labels, further reducing the
annotation burden, and it acts as a noise filter for poor quality images. We
use this framework for the segmentation of the cerebrovascular tree in
Time-of-Flight angiography (TOF) and Susceptibility-Weighted Images (SWI). The
results show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while
reducing the annotation time by ~77% w.r.t. learning-based segmentation methods
using pixel-wise labels for training."
LeViT-UNet: Make Faster Encoders with Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation plays an essential role in developing
computer-assisted diagnosis and therapy systems, yet still faces many
challenges. In the past few years, the popular encoder-decoder architectures
based on CNNs (e.g., U-Net) have been successfully applied in the task of
medical image segmentation. However, due to the locality of convolution
operations, they demonstrate limitations in learning global context and
long-range spatial relations. Recently, several researchers try to introduce
transformers to both the encoder and decoder components with promising results,
but the efficiency requires further improvement due to the high computational
complexity of transformers. In this paper, we propose LeViT-UNet, which
integrates a LeViT Transformer module into the U-Net architecture, for fast and
accurate medical image segmentation. Specifically, we use LeViT as the encoder
of the LeViT-UNet, which better trades off the accuracy and efficiency of the
Transformer block. Moreover, multi-scale feature maps from transformer blocks
and convolutional blocks of LeViT are passed into the decoder via
skip-connection, which can effectively reuse the spatial information of the
feature maps. Our experiments indicate that the proposed LeViT-UNet achieves
better performance comparing to various competing methods on several
challenging medical image segmentation benchmarks including Synapse and ACDC.
Code and models will be publicly available at
https://github.com/apple1986/LeViT_UNet."
Double Similarity Distillation for Semantic Image Segmentation,"The balance between high accuracy and high speed has always been a
challenging task in semantic image segmentation. Compact segmentation networks
are more widely used in the case of limited resources, while their performances
are constrained. In this paper, motivated by the residual learning and global
aggregation, we propose a simple yet general and effective knowledge
distillation framework called double similarity distillation (DSD) to improve
the classification accuracy of all existing compact networks by capturing the
similarity knowledge in pixel and category dimensions, respectively.
Specifically, we propose a pixel-wise similarity distillation (PSD) module that
utilizes residual attention maps to capture more detailed spatial dependencies
across multiple layers. Compared with exiting methods, the PSD module greatly
reduces the amount of calculation and is easy to expand. Furthermore,
considering the differences in characteristics between semantic segmentation
task and other computer vision tasks, we propose a category-wise similarity
distillation (CSD) module, which can help the compact segmentation network
strengthen the global category correlation by constructing the correlation
matrix. Combining these two modules, DSD framework has no extra parameters and
only a minimal increase in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on four challenging
datasets, including Cityscapes, CamVid, ADE20K, and Pascal VOC 2012, show that
DSD outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, proving its effectiveness and
generality. The code and models will be publicly available."
A Weighted Difference of Anisotropic and Isotropic Total Variation for Relaxed Mumford-Shah Color and Multiphase Image Segmentation,"In a class of piecewise-constant image segmentation models, we propose to
incorporate a weighted difference of anisotropic and isotropic total variation
(AITV) to regularize the partition boundaries in an image. In particular, we
replace the total variation regularization in the Chan-Vese segmentation model
and a fuzzy region competition model by the proposed AITV. To deal with the
nonconvex nature of AITV, we apply the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA), in
which the subproblems can be minimized by the primal-dual hybrid gradient
method with linesearch. The convergence of the DCA scheme is analyzed. In
addition, a generalization to color image segmentation is discussed. In the
numerical experiments, we compare the proposed models with the classic convex
approaches and the two-stage segmentation methods (smoothing and then
thresholding) on various images, showing that our models are effective in image
segmentation and robust with respect to impulsive noises."
What Image Features Boost Housing Market Predictions?,"The attractiveness of a property is one of the most interesting, yet
challenging, categories to model. Image characteristics are used to describe
certain attributes, and to examine the influence of visual factors on the price
or timeframe of the listing. In this paper, we propose a set of techniques for
the extraction of visual features for efficient numerical inclusion in
modern-day predictive algorithms. We discuss techniques such as Shannon's
entropy, calculating the center of gravity, employing image segmentation, and
using Convolutional Neural Networks. After comparing these techniques as
applied to a set of property-related images (indoor, outdoor, and satellite),
we conclude the following: (i) the entropy is the most efficient single-digit
visual measure for housing price prediction; (ii) image segmentation is the
most important visual feature for the prediction of housing lifespan; and (iii)
deep image features can be used to quantify interior characteristics and
contribute to captivation modeling. The set of 40 image features selected here
carries a significant amount of predictive power and outperforms some of the
strongest metadata predictors. Without any need to replace a human expert in a
real-estate appraisal process, we conclude that the techniques presented in
this paper can efficiently describe visible characteristics, thus introducing
perceived attractiveness as a quantitative measure into the predictive modeling
of housing."
Learning from Partially Overlapping Labels: Image Segmentation under Annotation Shift,"Scarcity of high quality annotated images remains a limiting factor for
training accurate image segmentation models. While more and more annotated
datasets become publicly available, the number of samples in each individual
database is often small. Combining different databases to create larger amounts
of training data is appealing yet challenging due to the heterogeneity as a
result of differences in data acquisition and annotation processes, often
yielding incompatible or even conflicting information. In this paper, we
investigate and propose several strategies for learning from partially
overlapping labels in the context of abdominal organ segmentation. We find that
combining a semi-supervised approach with an adaptive cross entropy loss can
successfully exploit heterogeneously annotated data and substantially improve
segmentation accuracy compared to baseline and alternative approaches."
TransClaw U-Net: Claw U-Net with Transformers for Medical Image Segmentation,"In recent years, computer-aided diagnosis has become an increasingly popular
topic. Methods based on convolutional neural networks have achieved good
performance in medical image segmentation and classification. Due to the
limitations of the convolution operation, the long-term spatial features are
often not accurately obtained. Hence, we propose a TransClaw U-Net network
structure, which combines the convolution operation with the transformer
operation in the encoding part. The convolution part is applied for extracting
the shallow spatial features to facilitate the recovery of the image resolution
after upsampling. The transformer part is used to encode the patches, and the
self-attention mechanism is used to obtain global information between
sequences. The decoding part retains the bottom upsampling structure for better
detail segmentation performance. The experimental results on Synapse
Multi-organ Segmentation Datasets show that the performance of TransClaw U-Net
is better than other network structures. The ablation experiments also prove
the generalization performance of TransClaw U-Net."
Privacy Preserving Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Medical Images,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have led to significant improvements in
tasks involving semantic segmentation of images. CNNs are vulnerable in the
area of biomedical image segmentation because of distributional gap between two
source and target domains with different data modalities which leads to domain
shift. Domain shift makes data annotations in new modalities necessary because
models must be retrained from scratch. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is
proposed to adapt a model to new modalities using solely unlabeled target
domain data. Common UDA algorithms require access to data points in the source
domain which may not be feasible in medical imaging due to privacy concerns. In
this work, we develop an algorithm for UDA in a privacy-constrained setting,
where the source domain data is inaccessible. Our idea is based on encoding the
information from the source samples into a prototypical distribution that is
used as an intermediate distribution for aligning the target domain
distribution with the source domain distribution. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it to state-of-the-art medical
image semantic segmentation approaches on two medical image semantic
segmentation datasets."
A Spatial Guided Self-supervised Clustering Network for Medical Image Segmentation,"The segmentation of medical images is a fundamental step in automated
clinical decision support systems. Existing medical image segmentation methods
based on supervised deep learning, however, remain problematic because of their
reliance on large amounts of labelled training data. Although medical imaging
data repositories continue to expand, there has not been a commensurate
increase in the amount of annotated data. Hence, we propose a new spatial
guided self-supervised clustering network (SGSCN) for medical image
segmentation, where we introduce multiple loss functions designed to aid in
grouping image pixels that are spatially connected and have similar feature
representations. It iteratively learns feature representations and clustering
assignment of each pixel in an end-to-end fashion from a single image. We also
propose a context-based consistency loss that better delineates the shape and
boundaries of image regions. It enforces all the pixels belonging to a cluster
to be spatially close to the cluster centre. We evaluated our method on 2
public medical image datasets and compared it to existing conventional and
self-supervised clustering methods. Experimental results show that our method
was most accurate for medical image segmentation."
Anatomy of Domain Shift Impact on U-Net Layers in MRI Segmentation,"Domain Adaptation (DA) methods are widely used in medical image segmentation
tasks to tackle the problem of differently distributed train (source) and test
(target) data. We consider the supervised DA task with a limited number of
annotated samples from the target domain. It corresponds to one of the most
relevant clinical setups: building a sufficiently accurate model on the minimum
possible amount of annotated data. Existing methods mostly fine-tune specific
layers of the pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, there is
no consensus on which layers are better to fine-tune, e.g. the first layers for
images with low-level domain shift or the deeper layers for images with
high-level domain shift. To this end, we propose SpotTUnet - a CNN architecture
that automatically chooses the layers which should be optimally fine-tuned.
More specifically, on the target domain, our method additionally learns the
policy that indicates whether a specific layer should be fine-tuned or reused
from the pretrained network. We show that our method performs at the same level
as the best of the nonflexible fine-tuning methods even under the extreme
scarcity of annotated data. Secondly, we show that SpotTUnet policy provides a
layer-wise visualization of the domain shift impact on the network, which could
be further used to develop robust domain generalization methods. In order to
extensively evaluate SpotTUnet performance, we use a publicly available dataset
of brain MR images (CC359), characterized by explicit domain shift. We release
a reproducible experimental pipeline."
Hierarchical Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Segmentation Based on Multi-Domain Data Aggregation,"A large labeled dataset is a key to the success of supervised deep learning,
but for medical image segmentation, it is highly challenging to obtain
sufficient annotated images for model training. In many scenarios, unannotated
images are abundant and easy to acquire. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has
shown great potentials in exploiting raw data information and representation
learning. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Supervised Learning
(HSSL), a new self-supervised framework that boosts medical image segmentation
by making good use of unannotated data. Unlike the current literature on
task-specific self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning,
we utilize SSL to learn task-agnostic knowledge from heterogeneous data for
various medical image segmentation tasks. Specifically, we first aggregate a
dataset from several medical challenges, then pre-train the network in a
self-supervised manner, and finally fine-tune on labeled data. We develop a new
loss function by combining contrastive loss and classification loss and
pretrain an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation tasks. Our extensive
experiments show that multi-domain joint pre-training benefits downstream
segmentation tasks and outperforms single-domain pre-training significantly.
Compared to learning from scratch, our new method yields better performance on
various tasks (e.g., +0.69% to +18.60% in Dice scores with 5% of annotated
data). With limited amounts of training data, our method can substantially
bridge the performance gap w.r.t. denser annotations (e.g., 10% vs.~100% of
annotated data)."
TransFuse: Fusing Transformers and CNNs for Medical Image Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation - the prerequisite of numerous clinical needs -
has been significantly prospered by recent advances in convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). However, it exhibits general limitations on modeling explicit
long-range relation, and existing cures, resorting to building deep encoders
along with aggressive downsampling operations, leads to redundant deepened
networks and loss of localized details. Hence, the segmentation task awaits a
better solution to improve the efficiency of modeling global contexts while
maintaining a strong grasp of low-level details. In this paper, we propose a
novel parallel-in-branch architecture, TransFuse, to address this challenge.
TransFuse combines Transformers and CNNs in a parallel style, where both global
dependency and low-level spatial details can be efficiently captured in a much
shallower manner. Besides, a novel fusion technique - BiFusion module is
created to efficiently fuse the multi-level features from both branches.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransFuse achieves the newest
state-of-the-art results on both 2D and 3D medical image sets including polyp,
skin lesion, hip, and prostate segmentation, with significant parameter
decrease and inference speed improvement."
Towards Robust General Medical Image Segmentation,"The reliability of Deep Learning systems depends on their accuracy but also
on their robustness against adversarial perturbations to the input data.
Several attacks and defenses have been proposed to improve the performance of
Deep Neural Networks under the presence of adversarial noise in the natural
image domain. However, robustness in computer-aided diagnosis for volumetric
data has only been explored for specific tasks and with limited attacks. We
propose a new framework to assess the robustness of general medical image
segmentation systems. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) we propose a new
benchmark to evaluate robustness in the context of the Medical Segmentation
Decathlon (MSD) by extending the recent AutoAttack natural image classification
framework to the domain of volumetric data segmentation, and (ii) we present a
novel lattice architecture for RObust Generic medical image segmentation (ROG).
Our results show that ROG is capable of generalizing across different tasks of
the MSD and largely surpasses the state-of-the-art under sophisticated
adversarial attacks."
Medical Matting: A New Perspective on Medical Segmentation with Uncertainty,"In medical image segmentation, it is difficult to mark ambiguous areas
accurately with binary masks, especially when dealing with small lesions.
Therefore, it is a challenge for radiologists to reach a consensus by using
binary masks under the condition of multiple annotations. However, these areas
may contain anatomical structures that are conducive to diagnosis. Uncertainty
is introduced to study these situations. Nevertheless, the uncertainty is
usually measured by the variances between predictions in a multiple trial way.
It is not intuitive, and there is no exact correspondence in the image.
Inspired by image matting, we introduce matting as a soft segmentation method
and a new perspective to deal with and represent uncertain regions into medical
scenes, namely medical matting. More specifically, because there is no
available medical matting dataset, we first labeled two medical datasets with
alpha matte. Secondly, the matting method applied to the natural image is not
suitable for the medical scene, so we propose a new architecture to generate
binary masks and alpha matte in a row. Thirdly, the uncertainty map is
introduced to highlight the ambiguous regions from the binary results and
improve the matting performance. Evaluated on these datasets, the proposed
model outperformed state-of-the-art matting algorithms by a large margin, and
alpha matte is proved to be a more efficient labeling form than a binary mask."
Flexibly Regularized Mixture Models and Application to Image Segmentation,"Probabilistic finite mixture models are widely used for unsupervised
clustering. These models can often be improved by adapting them to the topology
of the data. For instance, in order to classify spatially adjacent data points
similarly, it is common to introduce a Laplacian constraint on the posterior
probability that each data point belongs to a class. Alternatively, the mixing
probabilities can be treated as free parameters, while assuming Gauss-Markov or
more complex priors to regularize those mixing probabilities. However, these
approaches are constrained by the shape of the prior and often lead to
complicated or intractable inference. Here, we propose a new parametrization of
the Dirichlet distribution to flexibly regularize the mixing probabilities of
over-parametrized mixture distributions. Using the Expectation-Maximization
algorithm, we show that our approach allows us to define any linear update rule
for the mixing probabilities, including spatial smoothing regularization as a
special case. We then show that this flexible design can be extended to share
class information between multiple mixture models. We apply our algorithm to
artificial and natural image segmentation tasks, and we provide quantitative
and qualitative comparison of the performance of Gaussian and Student-t
mixtures on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. We also demonstrate how to
propagate class information across the layers of deep convolutional neural
networks in a probabilistically optimal way, suggesting a new interpretation
for feedback signals in biological visual systems. Our flexible approach can be
easily generalized to adapt probabilistic mixture models to arbitrary data
topologies."
Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation using Psychometric Learning,"Assigning meaning to parts of image data is the goal of semantic image
segmentation. Machine learning methods, specifically supervised learning is
commonly used in a variety of tasks formulated as semantic segmentation. One of
the major challenges in the supervised learning approaches is expressing and
collecting the rich knowledge that experts have with respect to the meaning
present in the image data. Towards this, typically a fixed set of labels is
specified and experts are tasked with annotating the pixels, patches or
segments in the images with the given labels. In general, however, the set of
classes does not fully capture the rich semantic information present in the
images. For example, in medical imaging such as histology images, the different
parts of cells could be grouped and sub-grouped based on the expertise of the
pathologist.
  To achieve such a precise semantic representation of the concepts in the
image, we need access to the full depth of knowledge of the annotator. In this
work, we develop a novel approach to collect segmentation annotations from
experts based on psychometric testing. Our method consists of the psychometric
testing procedure, active query selection, query enhancement, and a deep metric
learning model to achieve a patch-level image embedding that allows for
semantic segmentation of images. We show the merits of our method with
evaluation on the synthetically generated image, aerial image and histology
image."
Semi-supervised Left Atrium Segmentation with Mutual Consistency Training,"Semi-supervised learning has attracted great attention in the field of
machine learning, especially for medical image segmentation tasks, since it
alleviates the heavy burden of collecting abundant densely annotated data for
training. However, most of existing methods underestimate the importance of
challenging regions (e.g. small branches or blurred edges) during training. We
believe that these unlabeled regions may contain more crucial information to
minimize the uncertainty prediction for the model and should be emphasized in
the training process. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Mutual
Consistency Network (MC-Net) for semi-supervised left atrium segmentation from
3D MR images. Particularly, our MC-Net consists of one encoder and two slightly
different decoders, and the prediction discrepancies of two decoders are
transformed as an unsupervised loss by our designed cycled pseudo label scheme
to encourage mutual consistency. Such mutual consistency encourages the two
decoders to have consistent and low-entropy predictions and enables the model
to gradually capture generalized features from these unlabeled challenging
regions. We evaluate our MC-Net on the public Left Atrium (LA) database and it
obtains impressive performance gains by exploiting the unlabeled data
effectively. Our MC-Net outperforms six recent semi-supervised methods for left
atrium segmentation, and sets the new state-of-the-art performance on the LA
database."
Medical Transformer: Gated Axial-Attention for Medical Image Segmentation,"Over the past decade, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have been widely
adopted for medical image segmentation and shown to achieve adequate
performance. However, due to the inherent inductive biases present in the
convolutional architectures, they lack understanding of long-range dependencies
in the image. Recently proposed Transformer-based architectures that leverage
self-attention mechanism encode long-range dependencies and learn
representations that are highly expressive. This motivates us to explore
Transformer-based solutions and study the feasibility of using
Transformer-based network architectures for medical image segmentation tasks.
Majority of existing Transformer-based network architectures proposed for
vision applications require large-scale datasets to train properly. However,
compared to the datasets for vision applications, for medical imaging the
number of data samples is relatively low, making it difficult to efficiently
train transformers for medical applications. To this end, we propose a Gated
Axial-Attention model which extends the existing architectures by introducing
an additional control mechanism in the self-attention module. Furthermore, to
train the model effectively on medical images, we propose a Local-Global
training strategy (LoGo) which further improves the performance. Specifically,
we operate on the whole image and patches to learn global and local features,
respectively. The proposed Medical Transformer (MedT) is evaluated on three
different medical image segmentation datasets and it is shown that it achieves
better performance than the convolutional and other related transformer-based
architectures. Code: https://github.com/jeya-maria-jose/Medical-Transformer"
Label noise in segmentation networks : mitigation must deal with bias,"Imperfect labels limit the quality of predictions learned by deep neural
networks. This is particularly relevant in medical image segmentation, where
reference annotations are difficult to collect and vary significantly even
across expert annotators. Prior work on mitigating label noise focused on
simple models of mostly uniform noise. In this work, we explore biased and
unbiased errors artificially introduced to brain tumour annotations on MRI
data. We found that supervised and semi-supervised segmentation methods are
robust or fairly robust to unbiased errors but sensitive to biased errors. It
is therefore important to identify the sorts of errors expected in medical
image labels and especially mitigate the biased errors."
Quality-Aware Memory Network for Interactive Volumetric Image Segmentation,"Despite recent progress of automatic medical image segmentation techniques,
fully automatic results usually fail to meet the clinical use and typically
require further refinement. In this work, we propose a quality-aware memory
network for interactive segmentation of 3D medical images. Provided by user
guidance on an arbitrary slice, an interaction network is firstly employed to
obtain an initial 2D segmentation. The quality-aware memory network
subsequently propagates the initial segmentation estimation bidirectionally
over the entire volume. Subsequent refinement based on additional user guidance
on other slices can be incorporated in the same manner. To further facilitate
interactive segmentation, a quality assessment module is introduced to suggest
the next slice to segment based on the current segmentation quality of each
slice. The proposed network has two appealing characteristics: 1) The
memory-augmented network offers the ability to quickly encode past segmentation
information, which will be retrieved for the segmentation of other slices; 2)
The quality assessment module enables the model to directly estimate the
qualities of segmentation predictions, which allows an active learning paradigm
where users preferentially label the lowest-quality slice for multi-round
refinement. The proposed network leads to a robust interactive segmentation
engine, which can generalize well to various types of user annotations (e.g.,
scribbles, boxes). Experimental results on various medical datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our approach in comparison with existing techniques."
A Deep Learning Object Detection Method for an Efficient Clusters Initialization,"Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method grouping data samples
into clusters of similar objects. In practice, clustering has been used in
numerous applications such as banking customers profiling, document retrieval,
image segmentation, and e-commerce recommendation engines. However, the
existing clustering techniques present significant limitations, from which is
the dependability of their stability on the initialization parameters (e.g.
number of clusters, centroids). Different solutions were presented in the
literature to overcome this limitation (i.e. internal and external validation
metrics). However, these solutions require high computational complexity and
memory consumption, especially when dealing with big data. In this paper, we
apply the recent object detection Deep Learning (DL) model, named YOLO-v5, to
detect the initial clustering parameters such as the number of clusters with
their sizes and centroids. Mainly, the proposed solution consists of adding a
DL-based initialization phase making the clustering algorithms free of
initialization. Two model solutions are provided in this work, one for isolated
clusters and the other one for overlapping clusters. The features of the
incoming dataset determine which model to use. Moreover, The results show that
the proposed solution can provide near-optimal clusters initialization
parameters with low computational and resources overhead compared to existing
solutions."
CHASE: Robust Visual Tracking via Cell-Level Differentiable Neural Architecture Search,"A strong visual object tracker nowadays relies on its well-crafted modules,
which typically consist of manually-designed network architectures to deliver
high-quality tracking results. Not surprisingly, the manual design process
becomes a particularly challenging barrier, as it demands sufficient prior
experience, enormous effort, intuition and perhaps some good luck. Meanwhile,
neural architecture search has gaining grounds in practical applications such
as image segmentation, as a promising method in tackling the issue of automated
search of feasible network structures. In this work, we propose a novel
cell-level differentiable architecture search mechanism to automate the network
design of the tracking module, aiming to adapt backbone features to the
objective of a tracking network during offline training. The proposed approach
is simple, efficient, and with no need to stack a series of modules to
construct a network. Our approach is easy to be incorporated into existing
trackers, which is empirically validated using different differentiable
architecture search-based methods and tracking objectives. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach
over five commonly-used benchmarks. Meanwhile, our automated searching process
takes 41 (18) hours for the second (first) order DARTS method on the
TrackingNet dataset."
Cooperative Training and Latent Space Data Augmentation for Robust Medical Image Segmentation,"Deep learning-based segmentation methods are vulnerable to unforeseen data
distribution shifts during deployment, e.g. change of image appearances or
contrasts caused by different scanners, unexpected imaging artifacts etc. In
this paper, we present a cooperative framework for training image segmentation
models and a latent space augmentation method for generating hard examples.
Both contributions improve model generalization and robustness with limited
data. The cooperative training framework consists of a fast-thinking network
(FTN) and a slow-thinking network (STN). The FTN learns decoupled image
features and shape features for image reconstruction and segmentation tasks.
The STN learns shape priors for segmentation correction and refinement. The two
networks are trained in a cooperative manner. The latent space augmentation
generates challenging examples for training by masking the decoupled latent
space in both channel-wise and spatial-wise manners. We performed extensive
experiments on public cardiac imaging datasets. Using only 10 subjects from a
single site for training, we demonstrated improved cross-site segmentation
performance and increased robustness against various unforeseen imaging
artifacts compared to strong baseline methods. Particularly, cooperative
training with latent space data augmentation yields 15% improvement in terms of
average Dice score when compared to a standard training method."
UTNet: A Hybrid Transformer Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation,"Transformer architecture has emerged to be successful in a number of natural
language processing tasks. However, its applications to medical vision remain
largely unexplored. In this study, we present UTNet, a simple yet powerful
hybrid Transformer architecture that integrates self-attention into a
convolutional neural network for enhancing medical image segmentation. UTNet
applies self-attention modules in both encoder and decoder for capturing
long-range dependency at different scales with minimal overhead. To this end,
we propose an efficient self-attention mechanism along with relative position
encoding that reduces the complexity of self-attention operation significantly
from $O(n^2)$ to approximate $O(n)$. A new self-attention decoder is also
proposed to recover fine-grained details from the skipped connections in the
encoder. Our approach addresses the dilemma that Transformer requires huge
amounts of data to learn vision inductive bias. Our hybrid layer design allows
the initialization of Transformer into convolutional networks without a need of
pre-training. We have evaluated UTNet on the multi-label, multi-vendor cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging cohort. UTNet demonstrates superior segmentation
performance and robustness against the state-of-the-art approaches, holding the
promise to generalize well on other medical image segmentations."
Unsupervised Image Segmentation by Mutual Information Maximization and Adversarial Regularization,"Semantic segmentation is one of the basic, yet essential scene understanding
tasks for an autonomous agent. The recent developments in supervised machine
learning and neural networks have enjoyed great success in enhancing the
performance of the state-of-the-art techniques for this task. However, their
superior performance is highly reliant on the availability of a large-scale
annotated dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel fully unsupervised
semantic segmentation method, the so-called Information Maximization and
Adversarial Regularization Segmentation (InMARS). Inspired by human perception
which parses a scene into perceptual groups, rather than analyzing each pixel
individually, our proposed approach first partitions an input image into
meaningful regions (also known as superpixels). Next, it utilizes
Mutual-Information-Maximization followed by an adversarial training strategy to
cluster these regions into semantically meaningful classes. To customize an
adversarial training scheme for the problem, we incorporate adversarial pixel
noise along with spatial perturbations to impose photometrical and geometrical
invariance on the deep neural network. Our experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two commonly used
unsupervised semantic segmentation datasets, COCO-Stuff, and Potsdam."
Inter Extreme Points Geodesics for Weakly Supervised Segmentation,"We introduce $\textit{InExtremIS}$, a weakly supervised 3D approach to train
a deep image segmentation network using particularly weak train-time
annotations: only 6 extreme clicks at the boundary of the objects of interest.
Our fully-automatic method is trained end-to-end and does not require any
test-time annotations. From the extreme points, 3D bounding boxes are extracted
around objects of interest. Then, deep geodesics connecting extreme points are
generated to increase the amount of ""annotated"" voxels within the bounding
boxes. Finally, a weakly supervised regularised loss derived from a Conditional
Random Field formulation is used to encourage prediction consistency over
homogeneous regions. Extensive experiments are performed on a large open
dataset for Vestibular Schwannoma segmentation. $\textit{InExtremIS}$ obtained
competitive performance, approaching full supervision and outperforming
significantly other weakly supervised techniques based on bounding boxes.
Moreover, given a fixed annotation time budget, $\textit{InExtremIS}$
outperforms full supervision. Our code and data are available online."
Segmenting two-dimensional structures with strided tensor networks,"Tensor networks provide an efficient approximation of operations involving
high dimensional tensors and have been extensively used in modelling quantum
many-body systems. More recently, supervised learning has been attempted with
tensor networks, primarily focused on tasks such as image classification. In
this work, we propose a novel formulation of tensor networks for supervised
image segmentation which allows them to operate on high resolution medical
images. We use the matrix product state (MPS) tensor network on non-overlapping
patches of a given input image to predict the segmentation mask by learning a
pixel-wise linear classification rule in a high dimensional space. The proposed
model is end-to-end trainable using backpropagation. It is implemented as a
Strided Tensor Network to reduce the parameter complexity. The performance of
the proposed method is evaluated on two public medical imaging datasets and
compared to relevant baselines. The evaluation shows that the strided tensor
network yields competitive performance compared to CNN-based models while using
fewer resources. Additionally, based on the experiments we discuss the
feasibility of using fully linear models for segmentation tasks."
Segmentation with Multiple Acceptable Annotations: A Case Study of Myocardial Segmentation in Contrast Echocardiography,"Most existing deep learning-based frameworks for image segmentation assume
that a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.
This is true for many applications, but not all. Myocardial segmentation of
Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography (MCE), a critical task in automatic
myocardial perfusion analysis, is an example. Due to the low resolution and
serious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can
vary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,
how can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we
train the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by
proposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation
performance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our
proposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new
metric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn
general features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set
demonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function
outperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from
multiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, our
grading study shows that using extended Dice as an evaluation metric can better
identify segmentation results that need manual correction compared with using
Dice."
Information-Theoretic Segmentation by Inpainting Error Maximization,"We study image segmentation from an information-theoretic perspective,
proposing a novel adversarial method that performs unsupervised segmentation by
partitioning images into maximally independent sets. More specifically, we
group image pixels into foreground and background, with the goal of minimizing
predictability of one set from the other. An easily computed loss drives a
greedy search process to maximize inpainting error over these partitions. Our
method does not involve training deep networks, is computationally cheap,
class-agnostic, and even applicable in isolation to a single unlabeled image.
Experiments demonstrate that it achieves a new state-of-the-art in unsupervised
segmentation quality, while being substantially faster and more general than
competing approaches."
Are conditional GANs explicitly conditional?,"This paper proposes two important contributions for conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to improve the wide variety of applications that
exploit this architecture. The first main contribution is an analysis of cGANs
to show that they are not explicitly conditional. In particular, it will be
shown that the discriminator and subsequently the cGAN does not automatically
learn the conditionality between inputs. The second contribution is a new
method, called acontrario, that explicitly models conditionality for both parts
of the adversarial architecture via a novel acontrario loss that involves
training the discriminator to learn unconditional (adverse) examples. This
leads to a novel type of data augmentation approach for GANs (acontrario
learning) which allows to restrict the search space of the generator to
conditional outputs using adverse examples. Extensive experimentation is
carried out to evaluate the conditionality of the discriminator by proposing a
probability distribution analysis. Comparisons with the cGAN architecture for
different applications show significant improvements in performance on well
known datasets including, semantic image synthesis, image segmentation and
monocular depth prediction using different metrics including Fr\'echet
Inception Distance(FID), mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Root Mean Square
Error log (RMSE log) and Number of statistically-Different Bins (NDB)"
K-Net: Towards Unified Image Segmentation,"Semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentations have been addressed using
different and specialized frameworks despite their underlying connections. This
paper presents a unified, simple, and effective framework for these essentially
similar tasks. The framework, named K-Net, segments both instances and semantic
categories consistently by a group of learnable kernels, where each kernel is
responsible for generating a mask for either a potential instance or a stuff
class. To remedy the difficulties of distinguishing various instances, we
propose a kernel update strategy that enables each kernel dynamic and
conditional on its meaningful group in the input image. K-Net can be trained in
an end-to-end manner with bipartite matching, and its training and inference
are naturally NMS-free and box-free. Without bells and whistles, K-Net
surpasses all previous state-of-the-art single-model results of panoptic
segmentation on MS COCO and semantic segmentation on ADE20K with 52.1% PQ and
54.3% mIoU, respectively. Its instance segmentation performance is also on par
with Cascade Mask R-CNNon MS COCO with 60%-90% faster inference speeds. Code
and models will be released at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection."
Poisoning the Search Space in Neural Architecture Search,"Deep learning has proven to be a highly effective problem-solving tool for
object detection and image segmentation across various domains such as
healthcare and autonomous driving. At the heart of this performance lies neural
architecture design which relies heavily on domain knowledge and prior
experience on the researchers' behalf. More recently, this process of finding
the most optimal architectures, given an initial search space of possible
operations, was automated by Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this paper,
we evaluate the robustness of one such algorithm known as Efficient NAS (ENAS)
against data agnostic poisoning attacks on the original search space with
carefully designed ineffective operations. By evaluating algorithm performance
on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we empirically demonstrate how our novel search space
poisoning (SSP) approach and multiple-instance poisoning attacks exploit design
flaws in the ENAS controller to result in inflated prediction error rates for
child networks. Our results provide insights into the challenges to surmount in
using NAS for more adversarially robust architecture search."
Multi-Compound Transformer for Accurate Biomedical Image Segmentation,"The recent vision transformer(i.e.for image classification) learns non-local
attentive interaction of different patch tokens. However, prior arts miss
learning the cross-scale dependencies of different pixels, the semantic
correspondence of different labels, and the consistency of the feature
representations and semantic embeddings, which are critical for biomedical
segmentation. In this paper, we tackle the above issues by proposing a unified
transformer network, termed Multi-Compound Transformer (MCTrans), which
incorporates rich feature learning and semantic structure mining into a unified
framework. Specifically, MCTrans embeds the multi-scale convolutional features
as a sequence of tokens and performs intra- and inter-scale self-attention,
rather than single-scale attention in previous works. In addition, a learnable
proxy embedding is also introduced to model semantic relationship and feature
enhancement by using self-attention and cross-attention, respectively. MCTrans
can be easily plugged into a UNet-like network and attains a significant
improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in biomedical image segmentation
in six standard benchmarks. For example, MCTrans outperforms UNet by 3.64%,
3.71%, 4.34%, 2.8%, 1.88%, 1.57% in Pannuke, CVC-Clinic, CVC-Colon, Etis,
Kavirs, ISIC2018 dataset, respectively. Code is available at
https://github.com/JiYuanFeng/MCTrans."
TransBTS: Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Transformer,"Transformer, which can benefit from global (long-range) information modeling
using self-attention mechanisms, has been successful in natural language
processing and 2D image classification recently. However, both local and global
features are crucial for dense prediction tasks, especially for 3D medical
image segmentation. In this paper, we for the first time exploit Transformer in
3D CNN for MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation and propose a novel network named
TransBTS based on the encoder-decoder structure. To capture the local 3D
context information, the encoder first utilizes 3D CNN to extract the
volumetric spatial feature maps. Meanwhile, the feature maps are reformed
elaborately for tokens that are fed into Transformer for global feature
modeling. The decoder leverages the features embedded by Transformer and
performs progressive upsampling to predict the detailed segmentation map.
Extensive experimental results on both BraTS 2019 and 2020 datasets show that
TransBTS achieves comparable or higher results than previous state-of-the-art
3D methods for brain tumor segmentation on 3D MRI scans. The source code is
available at https://github.com/Wenxuan-1119/TransBTS"
ComBiNet: Compact Convolutional Bayesian Neural Network for Image Segmentation,"Fully convolutional U-shaped neural networks have largely been the dominant
approach for pixel-wise image segmentation. In this work, we tackle two defects
that hinder their deployment in real-world applications: 1) Predictions lack
uncertainty quantification that may be crucial to many decision-making systems;
2) Large memory storage and computational consumption demanding extensive
hardware resources. To address these issues and improve their practicality we
demonstrate a few-parameter compact Bayesian convolutional architecture, that
achieves a marginal improvement in accuracy in comparison to related work using
significantly fewer parameters and compute operations. The architecture
combines parameter-efficient operations such as separable convolutions,
bilinear interpolation, multi-scale feature propagation and Bayesian inference
for per-pixel uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo Dropout. The best
performing configurations required fewer than 2.5 million parameters on diverse
challenging datasets with few observations."
Semantics-aware Multi-modal Domain Translation:From LiDAR Point Clouds to Panoramic Color Images,"In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework to address the
domain translation problem between different sensor modalities with unique data
formats. By relying only on the semantics of the scene, our modular generative
framework can, for the first time, synthesize a panoramic color image from a
given full 3D LiDAR point cloud. The framework starts with semantic
segmentation of the point cloud, which is initially projected onto a spherical
surface. The same semantic segmentation is applied to the corresponding camera
image. Next, our new conditional generative model adversarially learns to
translate the predicted LiDAR segment maps to the camera image counterparts.
Finally, generated image segments are processed to render the panoramic scene
images. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation on the SemanticKitti
dataset and show that our proposed framework outperforms other strong baseline
models.
  Our source code is available at
https://github.com/halmstad-University/TITAN-NET"
Attention Toward Neighbors: A Context Aware Framework for High Resolution Image Segmentation,"High-resolution image segmentation remains challenging and error-prone due to
the enormous size of intermediate feature maps. Conventional methods avoid this
problem by using patch based approaches where each patch is segmented
independently. However, independent patch segmentation induces errors,
particularly at the patch boundary due to the lack of contextual information in
very high-resolution images where the patch size is much smaller compared to
the full image. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a
novel framework to segment a particular patch by incorporating contextual
information from its neighboring patches. This allows the segmentation network
to see the target patch with a wider field of view without the need of larger
feature maps. Comparative analysis from a number of experiments shows that our
proposed framework is able to segment high resolution images with significantly
improved mean Intersection over Union and overall accuracy."
Boosting Semi-supervised Image Segmentation with Global and Local Mutual Information Regularization,"The scarcity of labeled data often impedes the application of deep learning
to the segmentation of medical images. Semi-supervised learning seeks to
overcome this limitation by exploiting unlabeled examples in the learning
process. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised segmentation method
that leverages mutual information (MI) on categorical distributions to achieve
both global representation invariance and local smoothness. In this method, we
maximize the MI for intermediate feature embeddings that are taken from both
the encoder and decoder of a segmentation network. We first propose a global MI
loss constraining the encoder to learn an image representation that is
invariant to geometric transformations. Instead of resorting to
computationally-expensive techniques for estimating the MI on continuous
feature embeddings, we use projection heads to map them to a discrete cluster
assignment where MI can be computed efficiently. Our method also includes a
local MI loss to promote spatial consistency in the feature maps of the decoder
and provide a smoother segmentation. Since mutual information does not require
a strict ordering of clusters in two different assignments, we incorporate a
final consistency regularization loss on the output which helps align the
cluster labels throughout the network. We evaluate the method on four
challenging publicly-available datasets for medical image segmentation.
Experimental results show our method to outperform recently-proposed approaches
for semi-supervised segmentation and provide an accuracy near to full
supervision while training with very few annotated images."
Adapting Off-the-Shelf Source Segmenter for Target Medical Image Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from
a labeled source domain to an unlabeled and unseen target domain, which is
usually trained on data from both domains. Access to the source domain data at
the adaptation stage, however, is often limited, due to data storage or privacy
issues. To alleviate this, in this work, we target source free UDA for
segmentation, and propose to adapt an ``off-the-shelf"" segmentation model
pre-trained in the source domain to the target domain, with an adaptive
batch-wise normalization statistics adaptation framework. Specifically, the
domain-specific low-order batch statistics, i.e., mean and variance, are
gradually adapted with an exponential momentum decay scheme, while the
consistency of domain shareable high-order batch statistics, i.e., scaling and
shifting parameters, is explicitly enforced by our optimization objective. The
transferability of each channel is adaptively measured first from which to
balance the contribution of each channel. Moreover, the proposed source free
UDA framework is orthogonal to unsupervised learning methods, e.g.,
self-entropy minimization, which can thus be simply added on top of our
framework. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 database show that our
source free UDA framework outperformed existing source-relaxed UDA methods for
the cross-subtype UDA segmentation task and yielded comparable results for the
cross-modality UDA segmentation task, compared with a supervised UDA methods
with the source data."
Transformer Meets Convolution: A Bilateral Awareness Net-work for Semantic Segmentation of Very Fine Resolution Ur-ban Scene Images,"Semantic segmentation from very fine resolution (VFR) urban scene images
plays a significant role in several application scenarios including autonomous
driving, land cover classification, and urban planning, etc. However, the
tremendous details contained in the VFR image severely limit the potential of
the existing deep learning approaches. More seriously, the considerable
variations in scale and appearance of objects further deteriorate the
representational capacity of those se-mantic segmentation methods, leading to
the confusion of adjacent objects. Addressing such is-sues represents a
promising research field in the remote sensing community, which paves the way
for scene-level landscape pattern analysis and decision making. In this
manuscript, we pro-pose a bilateral awareness network (BANet) which contains a
dependency path and a texture path to fully capture the long-range
relationships and fine-grained details in VFR images. Specif-ically, the
dependency path is conducted based on the ResT, a novel Transformer backbone
with memory-efficient multi-head self-attention, while the texture path is
built on the stacked convo-lution operation. Besides, using the linear
attention mechanism, a feature aggregation module (FAM) is designed to
effectively fuse the dependency features and texture features. Extensive
experiments conducted on the three large-scale urban scene image segmentation
datasets, i.e., ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, ISPRS Potsdam dataset, and UAVid
dataset, demonstrate the effective-ness of our BANet. Specifically, a 64.6%
mIoU is achieved on the UAVid dataset."
Automatic Head Overcoat Thickness Measure with NASNet-Large-Decoder Net,"Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is one of the primary tools to show
microstructural characterization of materials as well as film thickness.
However, manual determination of film thickness from TEM images is
time-consuming as well as subjective, especially when the films in question are
very thin and the need for measurement precision is very high. Such is the case
for head overcoat (HOC) thickness measurements in the magnetic hard disk drive
industry. It is therefore necessary to develop software to automatically
measure HOC thickness. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a HOC
layer segmentation method using NASNet-Large as an encoder and then followed by
a decoder architecture, which is one of the most commonly used architectures in
deep learning for image segmentation. To further improve segmentation results,
we are the first to propose a post-processing layer to remove irrelevant
portions in the segmentation result. To measure the thickness of the segmented
HOC layer, we propose a regressive convolutional neural network (RCNN) model as
well as orthogonal thickness calculation methods. Experimental results
demonstrate a higher dice score for our model which has lower mean squared
error and outperforms current state-of-the-art manual measurement."
Distilling effective supervision for robust medical image segmentation with noisy labels,"Despite the success of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation
tasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with
high-quality annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect.
The fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which
leads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for
segmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust
training and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a
novel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective
supervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we
explicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise
estimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original
labels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust
learning method to accommodate more information as the complements to
pixel-level learning. We conduct extensive experiments on both simulated and
real-world noisy datasets. The results demonstrate the advantageous performance
of our method compared to state-of-the-art baselines for medical image
segmentation with noisy labels."
Improving Multi-Modal Learning with Uni-Modal Teachers,"Learning multi-modal representations is an essential step towards real-world
robotic applications, and various multi-modal fusion models have been developed
for this purpose. However, we observe that existing models, whose objectives
are mostly based on joint training, often suffer from learning inferior
representations of each modality. We name this problem Modality Failure, and
hypothesize that the imbalance of modalities and the implicit bias of common
objectives in fusion method prevent encoders of each modality from sufficient
feature learning. To this end, we propose a new multi-modal learning method,
Uni-Modal Teacher, which combines the fusion objective and uni-modal
distillation to tackle the modality failure problem. We show that our method
not only drastically improves the representation of each modality, but also
improves the overall multi-modal task performance. Our method can be
effectively generalized to most multi-modal fusion approaches. We achieve more
than 3% improvement on the VGGSound audio-visual classification task, as well
as improving performance on the NYU depth V2 RGB-D image segmentation task."
Large-scale image segmentation based on distributed clustering algorithms,"Many approaches to 3D image segmentation are based on hierarchical clustering
of supervoxels into image regions. Here we describe a distributed algorithm
capable of handling a tremendous number of supervoxels. The algorithm works
recursively, the regions are divided into chunks that are processed
independently in parallel by multiple workers. At each round of the recursive
procedure, the chunk size in all dimensions are doubled until a single chunk
encompasses the entire image. The final result is provably independent of the
chunking scheme, and the same as if the entire image were processed without
division into chunks. This is nontrivial because a pair of adjacent regions is
scored by some statistical property (e.g. mean or median) of the affinities at
the interface, and the interface may extend over arbitrarily many chunks. The
trick is to delay merge decisions for regions that touch chunk boundaries, and
only complete them in a later round after the regions are fully contained
within a chunk. We demonstrate the algorithm by clustering an affinity graph
with over 1.5 trillion edges between 135 billion supervoxels derived from a 3D
electron microscopic brain image."
"How to train your ViT? Data, Augmentation, and Regularization in Vision Transformers","Vision Transformers (ViT) have been shown to attain highly competitive
performance for a wide range of vision applications, such as image
classification, object detection and semantic image segmentation. In comparison
to convolutional neural networks, the Vision Transformer's weaker inductive
bias is generally found to cause an increased reliance on model regularization
or data augmentation (``AugReg'' for short) when training on smaller training
datasets. We conduct a systematic empirical study in order to better understand
the interplay between the amount of training data, AugReg, model size and
compute budget. As one result of this study we find that the combination of
increased compute and AugReg can yield models with the same performance as
models trained on an order of magnitude more training data: we train ViT models
of various sizes on the public ImageNet-21k dataset which either match or
outperform their counterparts trained on the larger, but not publicly available
JFT-300M dataset."
Positional Contrastive Learning for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation,"The success of deep learning heavily depends on the availability of large
labeled training sets. However, it is hard to get large labeled datasets in
medical image domain because of the strict privacy concern and costly labeling
efforts. Contrastive learning, an unsupervised learning technique, has been
proved powerful in learning image-level representations from unlabeled data.
The learned encoder can then be transferred or fine-tuned to improve the
performance of downstream tasks with limited labels. A critical step in
contrastive learning is the generation of contrastive data pairs, which is
relatively simple for natural image classification but quite challenging for
medical image segmentation due to the existence of the same tissue or organ
across the dataset. As a result, when applied to medical image segmentation,
most state-of-the-art contrastive learning frameworks inevitably introduce a
lot of false-negative pairs and result in degraded segmentation quality. To
address this issue, we propose a novel positional contrastive learning (PCL)
framework to generate contrastive data pairs by leveraging the position
information in volumetric medical images. Experimental results on CT and MRI
datasets demonstrate that the proposed PCL method can substantially improve the
segmentation performance compared to existing methods in both semi-supervised
setting and transfer learning setting."
Guided interactive image segmentation using machine learning and color based data set clustering,"We present a novel approach that combines machine learning based interactive
image segmentation using supervoxels with a clustering method for the automated
identification of similarly colored images in large data sets which enables a
guided reuse of classifiers. Our approach solves the problem of significant
color variability prevalent and often unavoidable in biological and medical
images which typically leads to deteriorated segmentation and quantification
accuracy thereby greatly reducing the necessary training effort. This increase
in efficiency facilitates the quantification of much larger numbers of images
thereby enabling interactive image analysis for recent new technological
advances in high-throughput imaging. The presented methods are applicable for
almost any image type and represent a useful tool for image analysis tasks in
general."
Knowledge distillation from multi-modal to mono-modal segmentation networks,"The joint use of multiple imaging modalities for medical image segmentation
has been widely studied in recent years. The fusion of information from
different modalities has demonstrated to improve the segmentation accuracy,
with respect to mono-modal segmentations, in several applications. However,
acquiring multiple modalities is usually not possible in a clinical setting due
to a limited number of physicians and scanners, and to limit costs and scan
time. Most of the time, only one modality is acquired. In this paper, we
propose KD-Net, a framework to transfer knowledge from a trained multi-modal
network (teacher) to a mono-modal one (student). The proposed method is an
adaptation of the generalized distillation framework where the student network
is trained on a subset (1 modality) of the teacher's inputs (n modalities). We
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in brain tumor
segmentation with the BraTS 2018 dataset. Using different architectures, we
show that the student network effectively learns from the teacher and always
outperforms the baseline mono-modal network in terms of segmentation accuracy."
Trilateral Attention Network for Real-time Medical Image Segmentation,"Accurate segmentation of medical images into anatomically meaningful regions
is critical for the extraction of quantitative indices or biomarkers. The
common pipeline for segmentation comprises regions of interest detection stage
and segmentation stage, which are independent of each other and typically
performed using separate deep learning networks. The performance of the
segmentation stage highly relies on the extracted set of spatial features and
the receptive fields. In this work, we propose an end-to-end network, called
Trilateral Attention Network (TaNet), for real-time detection and segmentation
in medical images. TaNet has a module for region localization, and three
segmentation pathways: 1) handcrafted pathway with hand-designed convolutional
kernels, 2) detail pathway with regular convolutional kernels, and 3) a global
pathway to enlarge the receptive field. The first two pathways encode rich
handcrafted and low-level features extracted by hand-designed and regular
kernels while the global pathway encodes high-level context information. By
jointly training the network for localization and segmentation using different
sets of features, TaNet achieved superior performance, in terms of accuracy and
speed, when evaluated on an echocardiography dataset for cardiac segmentation.
The code and models will be made publicly available in TaNet Github page."
CMF: Cascaded Multi-model Fusion for Referring Image Segmentation,"In this work, we address the task of referring image segmentation (RIS),
which aims at predicting a segmentation mask for the object described by a
natural language expression. Most existing methods focus on establishing
unidirectional or directional relationships between visual and linguistic
features to associate two modalities together, while the multi-scale context is
ignored or insufficiently modeled. Multi-scale context is crucial to localize
and segment those objects that have large scale variations during the
multi-modal fusion process. To solve this problem, we propose a simple yet
effective Cascaded Multi-modal Fusion (CMF) module, which stacks multiple
atrous convolutional layers in parallel and further introduces a cascaded
branch to fuse visual and linguistic features. The cascaded branch can
progressively integrate multi-scale contextual information and facilitate the
alignment of two modalities during the multi-modal fusion process. Experimental
results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms most
state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at
https://github.com/jianhua2022/CMF-Refseg."
Optimal Latent Vector Alignment for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Medical Image Segmentation,"This paper addresses the domain shift problem for segmentation. As a
solution, we propose OLVA, a novel and lightweight unsupervised domain
adaptation method based on a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and Optimal
Transport (OT) theory. Thanks to the VAE, our model learns a shared
cross-domain latent space that follows a normal distribution, which reduces the
domain shift. To guarantee valid segmentations, our shared latent space is
designed to model the shape rather than the intensity variations. We further
rely on an OT loss to match and align the remaining discrepancy between the two
domains in the latent space. We demonstrate OLVA's effectiveness for the
segmentation of multiple cardiac structures on the public Multi-Modality Whole
Heart Segmentation (MM-WHS) dataset, where the source domain consists of
annotated 3D MR images and the unlabelled target domain of 3D CTs. Our results
show remarkable improvements with an additional margin of 12.5\% dice score
over concurrent generative training approaches."
A Hybrid mmWave and Camera System for Long-Range Depth Imaging,"mmWave radars offer excellent depth resolution owing to their high bandwidth
at mmWave radio frequencies. Yet, they suffer intrinsically from poor angular
resolution, that is an order-of-magnitude worse than camera systems, and are
therefore not a capable 3-D imaging solution in isolation. We propose
Metamoran, a system that combines the complimentary strengths of radar and
camera systems to obtain depth images at high azimuthal resolutions at
distances of several tens of meters with high accuracy, all from a single fixed
vantage point. Metamoran enables rich long-range depth imaging outdoors with
applications to roadside safety infrastructure, surveillance and wide-area
mapping. Our key insight is to use the high azimuth resolution from cameras
using computer vision techniques, including image segmentation and monocular
depth estimation, to obtain object shapes and use these as priors for our novel
specular beamforming algorithm. We also design this algorithm to work in
cluttered environments with weak reflections and in partially occluded
scenarios. We perform a detailed evaluation of Metamoran's depth imaging and
sensing capabilities in 200 diverse scenes at a major U.S. city. Our evaluation
shows that Metamoran estimates the depth of an object up to 60~m away with a
median error of 28~cm, an improvement of 13$\times$ compared to a naive
radar+camera baseline and 23$\times$ compared to monocular depth estimation."
Bayesian dense inverse searching algorithm for real-time stereo matching in minimally invasive surgery,"This paper reports a CPU-level real-time stereo matching method for surgical
images (10 Hz on 640 * 480 image with a single core of i5-9400). The proposed
method is built on the fast ''dense inverse searching'' algorithm, which
estimates the disparity of the stereo images. The overlapping image patches
(arbitrary squared image segment) from the images at different scales are
aligned based on the photometric consistency presumption. We propose a Bayesian
framework to evaluate the probability of the optimized patch disparity at
different scales. Moreover, we introduce a spatial Gaussian mixed probability
distribution to address the pixel-wise probability within the patch. In-vivo
and synthetic experiments show that our method can handle ambiguities resulted
from the textureless surfaces and the photometric inconsistency caused by the
Lambertian reflectance. Our Bayesian method correctly balances the probability
of the patch for stereo images at different scales. Experiments indicate that
the estimated depth has higher accuracy and fewer outliers than the baseline
methods in the surgical scenario."
Adversarial Segmentation Loss for Sketch Colorization,"We introduce a new method for generating color images from sketches or edge
maps. Current methods either require some form of additional user-guidance or
are limited to the ""paired"" translation approach. We argue that segmentation
information could provide valuable guidance for sketch colorization. To this
end, we propose to leverage semantic image segmentation, as provided by a
general purpose panoptic segmentation network, to create an additional
adversarial loss function. Our loss function can be integrated to any baseline
GAN model. Our method is not limited to datasets that contain segmentation
labels, and it can be trained for ""unpaired"" translation tasks. We show the
effectiveness of our method on four different datasets spanning scene level
indoor, outdoor, and children book illustration images using qualitative,
quantitative and user study analysis. Our model improves its baseline up to 35
points on the FID metric. Our code and pretrained models can be found at
https://github.com/giddyyupp/AdvSegLoss."
DS-TransUNet:Dual Swin Transformer U-Net for Medical Image Segmentation,"Automatic medical image segmentation has made great progress benefit from the
development of deep learning. However, most existing methods are based on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which fail to build long-range
dependencies and global context connections due to the limitation of receptive
field in convolution operation. Inspired by the success of Transformer in
modeling the long-range contextual information, some researchers have expended
considerable efforts in designing the robust variants of Transformer-based
U-Net. Moreover, the patch division used in vision transformers usually ignores
the pixel-level intrinsic structural features inside each patch. To alleviate
these problems, we propose a novel deep medical image segmentation framework
called Dual Swin Transformer U-Net (DS-TransUNet), which might be the first
attempt to concurrently incorporate the advantages of hierarchical Swin
Transformer into both encoder and decoder of the standard U-shaped architecture
to enhance the semantic segmentation quality of varying medical images. Unlike
many prior Transformer-based solutions, the proposed DS-TransUNet first adopts
dual-scale encoder subnetworks based on Swin Transformer to extract the coarse
and fine-grained feature representations of different semantic scales. As the
core component for our DS-TransUNet, a well-designed Transformer Interactive
Fusion (TIF) module is proposed to effectively establish global dependencies
between features of different scales through the self-attention mechanism.
Furthermore, we also introduce the Swin Transformer block into decoder to
further explore the long-range contextual information during the up-sampling
process. Extensive experiments across four typical tasks for medical image
segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of DS-TransUNet, and show that our
approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
Self-Ensembling Contrastive Learning for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation,"Deep learning has demonstrated significant improvements in medical image
segmentation using a sufficiently large amount of training data with manual
labels. Acquiring well-representative labels requires expert knowledge and
exhaustive labors. In this paper, we aim to boost the performance of
semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation with limited labels
using a self-ensembling contrastive learning technique. To this end, we propose
to train an encoder-decoder network at image-level with small amounts of
labeled images, and more importantly, we learn latent representations directly
at feature-level by imposing contrastive loss on unlabeled images. This method
strengthens intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, so as to get
a better pixel classifier. Moreover, we devise a student encoder for online
learning and an exponential moving average version of it, called teacher
encoder, to improve the performance iteratively in a self-ensembling manner. To
construct contrastive samples with unlabeled images, two sampling strategies
that exploit structure similarity across medical images and utilize
pseudo-labels for construction, termed region-aware and anatomical-aware
contrastive sampling, are investigated. We conduct extensive experiments on an
MRI and a CT segmentation dataset and demonstrate that in a limited label
setting, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover,
the anatomical-aware strategy that prepares contrastive samples on-the-fly
using pseudo-labels realizes better contrastive regularization on feature
representations."
RLCorrector: Reinforced Proofreading for Connectomics Image Segmentation,"The segmentation of nanoscale electron microscopy (EM) images is crucial but
challenging in connectomics. Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated
the significant potential of automatic segmentation for tera-scale EM images.
However, none of the existing segmentation methods are error-free, and they
require proofreading, which is typically implemented as an interactive,
semi-automatic process via manual intervention. Herein, we propose a fully
automatic proofreading method based on reinforcement learning. The main idea is
to model the human decision process in proofreading using a reinforcement agent
to achieve fully automatic proofreading. We systematically design the proposed
system by combining multiple reinforcement learning agents in a hierarchical
manner, where each agent focuses only on a specific task while preserving
dependency between agents. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the episodic
task setting of reinforcement learning can efficiently manage a combination of
merge and split errors concurrently presented in the input. We demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed system by comparing it with state-of-the-art
proofreading methods using various testing examples."
Left Ventricle Contouring in Cardiac Images Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Medical image segmentation is one of the important tasks of computer-aided
diagnosis in medical image analysis. Since most medical images have the
characteristics of blurred boundaries and uneven intensity distribution,
through existing segmentation methods, the discontinuity within the target area
and the discontinuity of the target boundary are likely to lead to rough or
even erroneous boundary delineation. In this paper, we propose a new iterative
refined interactive segmentation method for medical images based on agent
reinforcement learning, which focuses on the problem of target segmentation
boundaries. We model the dynamic process of drawing the target contour in a
certain order as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based on a deep reinforcement
learning method. In the dynamic process of continuous interaction between the
agent and the image, the agent tracks the boundary point by point in order
within a limited length range until the contour of the target is completely
drawn. In this process, the agent can quickly improve the segmentation
performance by exploring an interactive policy in the image. The method we
proposed is simple and effective. At the same time, we evaluate our method on
the cardiac MRI scan data set. Experimental results show that our method has a
better segmentation effect on the left ventricle in a small number of medical
image data sets, especially in terms of segmentation boundaries, this method is
better than existing methods. Based on our proposed method, the dynamic
generation process of the predicted contour trajectory of the left ventricle
will be displayed online at https://github.com/H1997ym/LV-contour-trajectory."
GSVNet: Guided Spatially-Varying Convolution for Fast Semantic Segmentation on Video,"This paper addresses fast semantic segmentation on video.Video segmentation
often calls for real-time, or even fasterthan real-time, processing. One common
recipe for conserving computation arising from feature extraction is to
propagate features of few selected keyframes. However, recent advances in fast
image segmentation make these solutions less attractive. To leverage fast image
segmentation for furthering video segmentation, we propose a simple yet
efficient propagation framework. Specifically, we perform lightweight flow
estimation in 1/8-downscaled image space for temporal warping in segmentation
outpace space. Moreover, we introduce a guided spatially-varying convolution
for fusing segmentations derived from the previous and current frames, to
mitigate propagation error and enable lightweight feature extraction on
non-keyframes. Experimental results on Cityscapes and CamVid show that our
scheme achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy-throughput trade-off on video
segmentation."
Weakly Supervised Volumetric Image Segmentation with Deformed Templates,"There are many approaches that use weak-supervision to train networks to
segment 2D images. By contrast, existing 3D approaches rely on full-supervision
of a subset of 2D slices of the 3D image volume. In this paper, we propose an
approach that is truly weakly-supervised in the sense that we only need to
provide a sparse set of 3D point on the surface of target objects, an easy task
that can be quickly done. We use the 3D points to deform a 3D template so that
it roughly matches the target object outlines and we introduce an architecture
that exploits the supervision provided by coarse template to train a network to
find accurate boundaries.
  We evaluate the performance of our approach on Computed Tomography (CT),
Magnetic Resonance Imagery (MRI) and Electron Microscopy (EM) image datasets.
We will show that it outperforms a more traditional approach to
weak-supervision in 3D at a reduced supervision cost."
Few-shot segmentation of medical images based on meta-learning with implicit gradients,"Classical supervised methods commonly used often suffer from the requirement
of an abudant number of training samples and are unable to generalize on unseen
datasets. As a result, the broader application of any trained model is very
limited in clinical settings. However, few-shot approaches can minimize the
need for enormous reliable ground truth labels that are both labor intensive
and expensive. To this end, we propose to exploit an optimization-based
implicit model agnostic meta-learning {iMAML} algorithm in a few-shot setting
for medical image segmentation. Our approach can leverage the learned weights
from a diverse set of training samples and can be deployed on a new unseen
dataset. We show that unlike classical few-shot learning approaches, our method
has improved generalization capability. To our knowledge, this is the first
work that exploits iMAML for medical image segmentation. Our quantitative
results on publicly available skin and polyp datasets show that the proposed
method outperforms the naive supervised baseline model and two recent few-shot
segmentation approaches by large margins."
Using GANs to Augment Data for Cloud Image Segmentation Task,"While cloud/sky image segmentation has extensive real-world applications, a
large amount of labelled data is needed to train a highly accurate models to
perform the task. Scarcity of such volumes of cloud/sky images with
corresponding ground-truth binary maps makes it highly difficult to train such
complex image segmentation models. In this paper, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate data
to augment the training set in order to increase the prediction accuracy of
image segmentation model. We further present a way to estimate ground-truth
binary maps for the GAN-generated images to facilitate their effective use as
augmented images. Finally, we validate our work with different statistical
techniques."
Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation via Adaptive and Progressive Feature Alignment,"Contemporary domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to address data
annotation challenges by assuming that target domains are completely
unannotated. However, annotating a few target samples is usually very
manageable and worthwhile especially if it improves the adaptation performance
substantially. This paper presents SSDAS, a Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptive
image Segmentation network that employs a few labeled target samples as anchors
for adaptive and progressive feature alignment between labeled source samples
and unlabeled target samples. We position the few labeled target samples as
references that gauge the similarity between source and target features and
guide adaptive inter-domain alignment for learning more similar source
features. In addition, we replace the dissimilar source features by
high-confidence target features continuously during the iterative training
process, which achieves progressive intra-domain alignment between confident
and unconfident target features. Extensive experiments show the proposed SSDAS
greatly outperforms a number of baselines, i.e., UDA-based semantic
segmentation and SSDA-based image classification. In addition, SSDAS is
complementary and can be easily incorporated into UDA-based methods with
consistent improvements in domain adaptive semantic segmentation."
Points2Polygons: Context-Based Segmentation from Weak Labels Using Adversarial Networks,"In applied image segmentation tasks, the ability to provide numerous and
precise labels for training is paramount to the accuracy of the model at
inference time. However, this overhead is often neglected, and recently
proposed segmentation architectures rely heavily on the availability and
fidelity of ground truth labels to achieve state-of-the-art accuracies. Failure
to acknowledge the difficulty in creating adequate ground truths can lead to an
over-reliance on pre-trained models or a lack of adoption in real-world
applications. We introduce Points2Polygons (P2P), a model which makes use of
contextual metric learning techniques that directly addresses this problem.
Points2Polygons performs well against existing fully-supervised segmentation
baselines with limited training data, despite using lightweight segmentation
models (U-Net with a ResNet18 backbone) and having access to only weak labels
in the form of object centroids and no pre-training. We demonstrate this on
several different small but non-trivial datasets. We show that metric learning
using contextual data provides key insights for self-supervised tasks in
general, and allow segmentation models to easily generalize across
traditionally label-intensive domains in computer vision."
Attention-Guided Supervised Contrastive Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"Contrastive learning has shown superior performance in embedding global and
spatial invariant features in computer vision (e.g., image classification).
However, its overall success of embedding local and spatial variant features is
still limited, especially for semantic segmentation. In a per-pixel prediction
task, more than one label can exist in a single image for segmentation (e.g.,
an image contains both cat, dog, and grass), thereby it is difficult to define
'positive' or 'negative' pairs in a canonical contrastive learning setting. In
this paper, we propose an attention-guided supervised contrastive learning
approach to highlight a single semantic object every time as the target. With
our design, the same image can be embedded to different semantic clusters with
semantic attention (i.e., coerce semantic masks) as an additional input
channel. To achieve such attention, a novel two-stage training strategy is
presented. We evaluate the proposed method on multi-organ medical image
segmentation task, as our major task, with both in-house data and BTCV 2015
datasets. Comparing with the supervised and semi-supervised training
state-of-the-art in the backbone of ResNet-50, our proposed pipeline yields
substantial improvement of 5.53% and 6.09% in Dice score for both medical image
segmentation cohorts respectively. The performance of the proposed method on
natural images is assessed via PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and achieves 2.75%
substantial improvement."
IPatch: A Remote Adversarial Patch,"Applications such as autonomous vehicles and medical screening use deep
learning models to localize and identify hundreds of objects in a single frame.
In the past, it has been shown how an attacker can fool these models by placing
an adversarial patch within a scene. However, these patches must be placed in
the target location and do not explicitly alter the semantics elsewhere in the
image.
  In this paper, we introduce a new type of adversarial patch which alters a
model's perception of an image's semantics. These patches can be placed
anywhere within an image to change the classification or semantics of locations
far from the patch. We call this new class of adversarial examples `remote
adversarial patches' (RAP).
  We implement our own RAP called IPatch and perform an in-depth analysis on
image segmentation RAP attacks using five state-of-the-art architectures with
eight different encoders on the CamVid street view dataset. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the attack can be extended to object recognition models with
preliminary results on the popular YOLOv3 model. We found that the patch can
change the classification of a remote target region with a success rate of up
to 93% on average."
nnDetection: A Self-configuring Method for Medical Object Detection,"Simultaneous localisation and categorization of objects in medical images,
also referred to as medical object detection, is of high clinical relevance
because diagnostic decisions often depend on rating of objects rather than e.g.
pixels. For this task, the cumbersome and iterative process of method
configuration constitutes a major research bottleneck. Recently, nnU-Net has
tackled this challenge for the task of image segmentation with great success.
Following nnU-Net's agenda, in this work we systematize and automate the
configuration process for medical object detection. The resulting
self-configuring method, nnDetection, adapts itself without any manual
intervention to arbitrary medical detection problems while achieving results en
par with or superior to the state-of-the-art. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of nnDetection on two public benchmarks, ADAM and LUNA16, and propose 10
further medical object detection tasks on public data sets for comprehensive
method evaluation. Code is at https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnDetection ."
A Thorough View of Exact Inference in Graphs from the Degree-4 Sum-of-Squares Hierarchy,"Performing inference in graphs is a common task within several machine
learning problems, e.g., image segmentation, community detection, among others.
For a given undirected connected graph, we tackle the statistical problem of
exactly recovering an unknown ground-truth binary labeling of the nodes from a
single corrupted observation of each edge. Such problem can be formulated as a
quadratic combinatorial optimization problem over the boolean hypercube, where
it has been shown before that one can (with high probability and in polynomial
time) exactly recover the ground-truth labeling of graphs that have an
isoperimetric number that grows with respect to the number of nodes (e.g.,
complete graphs, regular expanders). In this work, we apply a powerful
hierarchy of relaxations, known as the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy, to the
combinatorial problem. Motivated by empirical evidence on the improvement in
exact recoverability, we center our attention on the degree-4 SoS relaxation
and set out to understand the origin of such improvement from a graph
theoretical perspective. We show that the solution of the dual of the relaxed
problem is related to finding edge weights of the Johnson and Kneser graphs,
where the weights fulfill the SoS constraints and intuitively allow the input
graph to increase its algebraic connectivity. Finally, as byproduct of our
analysis, we derive a novel Cheeger-type lower bound for the algebraic
connectivity of graphs with signed edge weights."
Analysis of Vision-based Abnormal Red Blood Cell Classification,"Identification of abnormalities in red blood cells (RBC) is key to diagnosing
a range of medical conditions from anaemia to liver disease. Currently this is
done manually, a time-consuming and subjective process. This paper presents an
automated process utilising the advantages of machine learning to increase
capacity and standardisation of cell abnormality detection, and its performance
is analysed. Three different machine learning technologies were used: a Support
Vector Machine (SVM), a classical machine learning technology; TabNet, a deep
learning architecture for tabular data; U-Net, a semantic segmentation network
designed for medical image segmentation. A critical issue was the highly
imbalanced nature of the dataset which impacts the efficacy of machine
learning. To address this, synthesising minority class samples in feature space
was investigated via Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and
cost-sensitive learning. A combination of these two methods is investigated to
improve the overall performance. These strategies were found to increase
sensitivity to minority classes. The impact of unknown cells on semantic
segmentation is demonstrated, with some evidence of the model applying learning
of labelled cells to these anonymous cells. These findings indicate both
classical models and new deep learning networks as promising methods in
automating RBC abnormality detection."
DAAIN: Detection of Anomalous and Adversarial Input using Normalizing Flows,"Despite much recent work, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs and
adversarial attacks (AA) for computer vision models remains a challenge. In
this work, we introduce a novel technique, DAAIN, to detect OOD inputs and AA
for image segmentation in a unified setting. Our approach monitors the inner
workings of a neural network and learns a density estimator of the activation
distribution. We equip the density estimator with a classification head to
discriminate between regular and anomalous inputs. To deal with the
high-dimensional activation-space of typical segmentation networks, we
subsample them to obtain a homogeneous spatial and layer-wise coverage. The
subsampling pattern is chosen once per monitored model and kept fixed for all
inputs. Since the attacker has access to neither the detection model nor the
sampling key, it becomes harder for them to attack the segmentation network, as
the attack cannot be backpropagated through the detector. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach using an ESPNet trained on the Cityscapes dataset
as segmentation model, an affine Normalizing Flow as density estimator and use
blue noise to ensure homogeneous sampling. Our model can be trained on a single
GPU making it compute efficient and deployable without requiring specialized
accelerators."
CFPNet-M: A Light-Weight Encoder-Decoder Based Network for Multimodal Biomedical Image Real-Time Segmentation,"Currently, developments of deep learning techniques are providing
instrumental to identify, classify, and quantify patterns in medical images.
Segmentation is one of the important applications in medical image analysis. In
this regard, U-Net is the predominant approach to medical image segmentation
tasks. However, we found that those U-Net based models have limitations in
several aspects, for example, millions of parameters in the U-Net consuming
considerable computation resource and memory, lack of global information, and
missing some tough objects. Therefore, we applied two modifications to improve
the U-Net model: 1) designed and added the dilated channel-wise CNN module, 2)
simplified the U shape network. Based on these two modifications, we proposed a
novel light-weight architecture -- Channel-wise Feature Pyramid Network for
Medicine (CFPNet-M). To evaluate our method, we selected five datasets with
different modalities: thermography, electron microscopy, endoscopy, dermoscopy,
and digital retinal images. And we compared its performance with several models
having different parameter scales. This paper also involves our previous
studies of DC-UNet and some commonly used light-weight neural networks. We
applied the Tanimoto similarity instead of the Jaccard index for gray-level
image measurements. By comparison, CFPNet-M achieves comparable segmentation
results on all five medical datasets with only 0.65 million parameters, which
is about 2% of U-Net, and 8.8 MB memory. Meanwhile, the inference speed can
reach 80 FPS on a single RTX 2070Ti GPU with the 256 by 192 pixels input size."
High-Resolution Segmentation of Tooth Root Fuzzy Edge Based on Polynomial Curve Fitting with Landmark Detection,"As the most economical and routine auxiliary examination in the diagnosis of
root canal treatment, oral X-ray has been widely used by stomatologists. It is
still challenging to segment the tooth root with a blurry boundary for the
traditional image segmentation method. To this end, we propose a model for
high-resolution segmentation based on polynomial curve fitting with landmark
detection (HS-PCL). It is based on detecting multiple landmarks evenly
distributed on the edge of the tooth root to fit a smooth polynomial curve as
the segmentation of the tooth root, thereby solving the problem of fuzzy edge.
In our model, a maximum number of the shortest distances algorithm (MNSDA) is
proposed to automatically reduce the negative influence of the wrong landmarks
which are detected incorrectly and deviate from the tooth root on the fitting
result. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach not
only reduces Hausdorff95 (HD95) by 33.9% and Average Surface Distance (ASD) by
42.1% compared with the state-of-the-art method, but it also achieves excellent
results on the minute quantity of datasets, which greatly improves the
feasibility of automatic root canal therapy evaluation by medical image
computing."
Predicting the Solar Potential of Rooftops using Image Segmentation and Structured Data,"Estimating the amount of electricity that can be produced by rooftop
photovoltaic systems is a time-consuming process that requires on-site
measurements, a difficult task to achieve on a large scale. In this paper, we
present an approach to estimate the solar potential of rooftops based on their
location and architectural characteristics, as well as the amount of solar
radiation they receive annually. Our technique uses computer vision to achieve
semantic segmentation of roof sections and roof objects on the one hand, and a
machine learning model based on structured building features to predict roof
pitch on the other hand. We then compute the azimuth and maximum number of
solar panels that can be installed on a rooftop with geometric approaches.
Finally, we compute precise shading masks and combine them with solar
irradiation data that enables us to estimate the yearly solar potential of a
rooftop."
Learning Fuzzy Clustering for SPECT/CT Segmentation via Convolutional Neural Networks,"Quantitative bone single-photon emission computed tomography (QBSPECT) has
the potential to provide a better quantitative assessment of bone metastasis
than planar bone scintigraphy due to its ability to better quantify activity in
overlapping structures. An important element of assessing response of bone
metastasis is accurate image segmentation. However, limited by the properties
of QBSPECT images, the segmentation of anatomical regions-of-interests (ROIs)
still relies heavily on the manual delineation by experts. This work proposes a
fast and robust automated segmentation method for partitioning a QBSPECT image
into lesion, bone, and background. We present a new unsupervised segmentation
loss function and its semi- and supervised variants for training a
convolutional neural network (ConvNet). The loss functions were developed based
on the objective function of the classical Fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm. We
conducted a comprehensive study to compare our proposed methods with ConvNets
trained using supervised loss functions and conventional clustering methods.
The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and several other metrics were used as
figures of merit as applied to the task of delineating lesion and bone in both
simulated and clinical SPECT/CT images. We experimentally demonstrated that the
proposed methods yielded good segmentation results on a clinical dataset even
though the training was done using realistic simulated images. A ConvNet-based
image segmentation method that uses novel loss functions was developed and
evaluated. The method can operate in unsupervised, semi-supervised, or
fully-supervised modes depending on the availability of annotated training
data. The results demonstrated that the proposed method provides fast and
robust lesion and bone segmentation for QBSPECT/CT. The method can potentially
be applied to other medical image segmentation applications."
Argmax Flows and Multinomial Diffusion: Learning Categorical Distributions,"Generative flows and diffusion models have been predominantly trained on
ordinal data, for example natural images. This paper introduces two extensions
of flows and diffusion for categorical data such as language or image
segmentation: Argmax Flows and Multinomial Diffusion. Argmax Flows are defined
by a composition of a continuous distribution (such as a normalizing flow), and
an argmax function. To optimize this model, we learn a probabilistic inverse
for the argmax that lifts the categorical data to a continuous space.
Multinomial Diffusion gradually adds categorical noise in a diffusion process,
for which the generative denoising process is learned. We demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing dequantization approaches on text modelling and
modelling on image segmentation maps in log-likelihood."
Learning Uncertainty For Safety-Oriented Semantic Segmentation In Autonomous Driving,"In this paper, we show how uncertainty estimation can be leveraged to enable
safety critical image segmentation in autonomous driving, by triggering a
fallback behavior if a target accuracy cannot be guaranteed. We introduce a new
uncertainty measure based on disagreeing predictions as measured by a
dissimilarity function. We propose to estimate this dissimilarity by training a
deep neural architecture in parallel to the task-specific network. It allows
this observer to be dedicated to the uncertainty estimation, and let the
task-specific network make predictions. We propose to use self-supervision to
train the observer, which implies that our method does not require additional
training data. We show experimentally that our proposed approach is much less
computationally intensive at inference time than competing methods (e.g.
MCDropout), while delivering better results on safety-oriented evaluation
metrics on the CamVid dataset, especially in the case of glare artifacts."
BoundarySqueeze: Image Segmentation as Boundary Squeezing,"We propose a novel method for fine-grained high-quality image segmentation of
both objects and scenes. Inspired by dilation and erosion from morphological
image processing techniques, we treat the pixel level segmentation problems as
squeezing object boundary. From this perspective, we propose \textbf{Boundary
Squeeze} module: a novel and efficient module that squeezes the object boundary
from both inner and outer directions which leads to precise mask
representation. To generate such squeezed representation, we propose a new
bidirectionally flow-based warping process and design specific loss signals to
supervise the learning process. Boundary Squeeze Module can be easily applied
to both instance and semantic segmentation tasks as a plug-and-play module by
building on top of existing models. We show that our simple yet effective
design can lead to high qualitative results on several different datasets and
we also provide several different metrics on boundary to prove the
effectiveness over previous work. Moreover, the proposed module is
light-weighted and thus has potential for practical usage. Our method yields
large gains on COCO, Cityscapes, for both instance and semantic segmentation
and outperforms previous state-of-the-art PointRend in both accuracy and speed
under the same setting. Code and model will be available."
Gaussian Dynamic Convolution for Efficient Single-Image Segmentation,"Interactive single-image segmentation is ubiquitous in the scientific and
commercial imaging software. In this work, we focus on the single-image
segmentation problem only with some seeds such as scribbles. Inspired by the
dynamic receptive field in the human being's visual system, we propose the
Gaussian dynamic convolution (GDC) to fast and efficiently aggregate the
contextual information for neural networks. The core idea is randomly selecting
the spatial sampling area according to the Gaussian distribution offsets. Our
GDC can be easily used as a module to build lightweight or complex segmentation
networks. We adopt the proposed GDC to address the typical single-image
segmentation tasks. Furthermore, we also build a Gaussian dynamic pyramid
Pooling to show its potential and generality in common semantic segmentation.
Experiments demonstrate that the GDC outperforms other existing convolutions on
three benchmark segmentation datasets including Pascal-Context, Pascal-VOC
2012, and Cityscapes. Additional experiments are also conducted to illustrate
that the GDC can produce richer and more vivid features compared with other
convolutions. In general, our GDC is conducive to the convolutional neural
networks to form an overall impression of the image."
Full Page Handwriting Recognition via Image to Sequence Extraction,"We present a Neural Network based Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) model
architecture that can be trained to recognize full pages of handwritten or
printed text without image segmentation. Being based on Image to Sequence
architecture, it can extract text present in an image and then sequence it
correctly without imposing any constraints regarding orientation, layout and
size of text and non-text. Further, it can also be trained to generate
auxiliary markup related to formatting, layout and content. We use character
level vocabulary, thereby enabling language and terminology of any subject. The
model achieves a new state-of-art in paragraph level recognition on the IAM
dataset. When evaluated on scans of real world handwritten free form test
answers - beset with curved and slanted lines, drawings, tables, math,
chemistry and other symbols - it performs better than all commercially
available HTR cloud APIs. It is deployed in production as part of a commercial
web application."
"Uma implementação do jogo Pedra, Papel e Tesoura utilizando Visao Computacional","This paper presents a game, controlled by computer vision, in identification
of hand gestures (hand-tracking). The proposed work is based on image
segmentation and construction of a convex hull with Jarvis Algorithm , and
determination of the pattern based on the extraction of area characteristics in
the convex hull."
Deep Active Contours Using Locally Controlled Distance Vector Flow,"Active contours Model (ACM) has been extensively used in computer vision and
image processing. In recent studies, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have
been combined with active contours replacing the user in the process of contour
evolution and image segmentation to eliminate limitations associated with ACM's
dependence on parameters of the energy functional and initialization. However,
prior works did not aim for automatic initialization which is addressed here.
In addition to manual initialization, current methods are highly sensitive to
initial location and fail to delineate borders accurately. We propose a fully
automatic image segmentation method to address problems of manual
initialization, insufficient capture range, and poor convergence to boundaries,
in addition to the problem of assignment of energy functional parameters. We
train two CNNs, which predict active contour weighting parameters and generate
a ground truth mask to extract Distance Transform (DT) and an initialization
circle. Distance transform is used to form a vector field pointing from each
pixel of the image towards the closest point on the boundary, the size of which
is equal to the Euclidean distance map. We evaluate our method on four publicly
available datasets including two building instance segmentation datasets,
Vaihingen and Bing huts, and two mammography image datasets, INBreast and
DDSM-BCRP. Our approach outperforms latest research by 0.59 ans 2.39 percent in
mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), 7.38 and 8.62 percent in Boundary F-score
(BoundF) for Vaihingen and Bing huts datasets, respectively. Dice similarity
coefficient for the INBreast and DDSM-BCRP datasets is 94.23% and 90.89%,
respectively indicating our method is comparable to state-of-the-art
frameworks."
SemSegLoss: A python package of loss functions for semantic segmentation,"Image Segmentation has been an active field of research as it has a wide
range of applications, ranging from automated disease detection to self-driving
cars. In recent years, various research papers proposed different loss
functions used in case of biased data, sparse segmentation, and unbalanced
dataset. In this paper, we introduce SemSegLoss, a python package consisting of
some of the well-known loss functions widely used for image segmentation. It is
developed with the intent to help researchers in the development of novel loss
functions and perform an extensive set of experiments on model architectures
for various applications. The ease-of-use and flexibility of the presented
package have allowed reducing the development time and increased evaluation
strategies of machine learning models for semantic segmentation. Furthermore,
different applications that use image segmentation can use SemSegLoss because
of the generality of its functions. This wide range of applications will lead
to the development and growth of AI across all industries."
Finding an Unsupervised Image Segmenter in Each of Your Deep Generative Models,"Recent research has shown that numerous human-interpretable directions exist
in the latent space of GANs. In this paper, we develop an automatic procedure
for finding directions that lead to foreground-background image separation, and
we use these directions to train an image segmentation model without human
supervision. Our method is generator-agnostic, producing strong segmentation
results with a wide range of different GAN architectures. Furthermore, by
leveraging GANs pretrained on large datasets such as ImageNet, we are able to
segment images from a range of domains without further training or finetuning.
Evaluating our method on image segmentation benchmarks, we compare favorably to
prior work while using neither human supervision nor access to the training
data. Broadly, our results demonstrate that automatically extracting
foreground-background structure from pretrained deep generative models can
serve as a remarkably effective substitute for human supervision."
Voxel-level Siamese Representation Learning for Abdominal Multi-Organ Segmentation,"Recent works in medical image segmentation have actively explored various
deep learning architectures or objective functions to encode high-level
features from volumetric data owing to limited image annotations. However, most
existing approaches tend to ignore cross-volume global context and define
context relations in the decision space. In this work, we propose a novel
voxel-level Siamese representation learning method for abdominal multi-organ
segmentation to improve representation space. The proposed method enforces
voxel-wise feature relations in the representation space for leveraging limited
datasets more comprehensively to achieve better performance. Inspired by recent
progress in contrastive learning, we suppressed voxel-wise relations from the
same class to be projected to the same point without using negative samples.
Moreover, we introduce a multi-resolution context aggregation method that
aggregates features from multiple hidden layers, which encodes both the global
and local contexts for segmentation. Our experiments on the multi-organ dataset
outperformed the existing approaches by 2% in Dice score coefficient. The
qualitative visualizations of the representation spaces demonstrate that the
improvements were gained primarily by a disentangled feature space."
CheXseg: Combining Expert Annotations with DNN-generated Saliency Maps for X-ray Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation models are typically supervised by expert
annotations at the pixel-level, which can be expensive to acquire. In this
work, we propose a method that combines the high quality of pixel-level expert
annotations with the scale of coarse DNN-generated saliency maps for training
multi-label semantic segmentation models. We demonstrate the application of our
semi-supervised method, which we call CheXseg, on multi-label chest X-ray
interpretation. We find that CheXseg improves upon the performance (mIoU) of
fully-supervised methods that use only pixel-level expert annotations by 9.7%
and weakly-supervised methods that use only DNN-generated saliency maps by
73.1%. Our best method is able to match radiologist agreement on three out of
ten pathologies and reduces the overall performance gap by 57.2% as compared to
weakly-supervised methods."
GeoSim: Realistic Video Simulation via Geometry-Aware Composition for Self-Driving,"Scalable sensor simulation is an important yet challenging open problem for
safety-critical domains such as self-driving. Current works in image simulation
either fail to be photorealistic or do not model the 3D environment and the
dynamic objects within, losing high-level control and physical realism. In this
paper, we present GeoSim, a geometry-aware image composition process which
synthesizes novel urban driving scenarios by augmenting existing images with
dynamic objects extracted from other scenes and rendered at novel poses.
Towards this goal, we first build a diverse bank of 3D objects with both
realistic geometry and appearance from sensor data. During simulation, we
perform a novel geometry-aware simulation-by-composition procedure which 1)
proposes plausible and realistic object placements into a given scene, 2)
render novel views of dynamic objects from the asset bank, and 3) composes and
blends the rendered image segments. The resulting synthetic images are
realistic, traffic-aware, and geometrically consistent, allowing our approach
to scale to complex use cases. We demonstrate two such important applications:
long-range realistic video simulation across multiple camera sensors, and
synthetic data generation for data augmentation on downstream segmentation
tasks. Please check https://tmux.top/publication/geosim/ for high-resolution
video results."
Cross-Modal Progressive Comprehension for Referring Segmentation,"Given a natural language expression and an image/video, the goal of referring
segmentation is to produce the pixel-level masks of the entities described by
the subject of the expression. Previous approaches tackle this problem by
implicit feature interaction and fusion between visual and linguistic
modalities in a one-stage manner. However, human tends to solve the referring
problem in a progressive manner based on informative words in the expression,
i.e., first roughly locating candidate entities and then distinguishing the
target one. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Progressive Comprehension
(CMPC) scheme to effectively mimic human behaviors and implement it as a CMPC-I
(Image) module and a CMPC-V (Video) module to improve referring image and video
segmentation models. For image data, our CMPC-I module first employs entity and
attribute words to perceive all the related entities that might be considered
by the expression. Then, the relational words are adopted to highlight the
target entity as well as suppress other irrelevant ones by spatial graph
reasoning. For video data, our CMPC-V module further exploits action words
based on CMPC-I to highlight the correct entity matched with the action cues by
temporal graph reasoning. In addition to the CMPC, we also introduce a simple
yet effective Text-Guided Feature Exchange (TGFE) module to integrate the
reasoned multimodal features corresponding to different levels in the visual
backbone under the guidance of textual information. In this way, multi-level
features can communicate with each other and be mutually refined based on the
textual context. Combining CMPC-I or CMPC-V with TGFE can form our image or
video version referring segmentation frameworks and our frameworks achieve new
state-of-the-art performances on four referring image segmentation benchmarks
and three referring video segmentation benchmarks respectively."
Momentum Contrastive Voxel-wise Representation Learning for Semi-supervised Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation,"Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that
requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, manually annotating
medical data is often laborious, and most existing learning-based approaches
fail to accurately delineate object boundaries without effective geometric
constraints. Contrastive learning, a sub-area of self-supervised learning, has
recently been noted as a promising direction in multiple application fields. In
this work, we present a novel Contrastive Voxel-wise Representation Learning
(CVRL) method with geometric constraints to learn global-local visual
representations for volumetric medical image segmentation with limited
annotations. Our framework can effectively learn global and local features by
capturing 3D spatial context and rich anatomical information. Specifically, we
introduce a voxel-to-volume contrastive algorithm to learn global information
from 3D images, and propose to perform local voxel-to-voxel contrast to
explicitly make use of local cues in the embedding space. Moreover, we
integrate an elastic interaction-based active contour model as a geometric
regularization term to enable fast and reliable object delineations in an
end-to-end learning manner. Results on the Atrial Segmentation Challenge
dataset demonstrate superiority of our proposed scheme, especially in a setting
with a very limited number of annotated data."
VICE: Visual Identification and Correction of Neural Circuit Errors,"A connectivity graph of neurons at the resolution of single synapses provides
scientists with a tool for understanding the nervous system in health and
disease. Recent advances in automatic image segmentation and synapse prediction
in electron microscopy (EM) datasets of the brain have made reconstructions of
neurons possible at the nanometer scale. However, automatic segmentation
sometimes struggles to segment large neurons correctly, requiring human effort
to proofread its output. General proofreading involves inspecting large volumes
to correct segmentation errors at the pixel level, a visually intensive and
time-consuming process. This paper presents the design and implementation of an
analytics framework that streamlines proofreading, focusing on
connectivity-related errors. We accomplish this with automated likely-error
detection and synapse clustering that drives the proofreading effort with
highly interactive 3D visualizations. In particular, our strategy centers on
proofreading the local circuit of a single cell to ensure a basic level of
completeness. We demonstrate our framework's utility with a user study and
report quantitative and subjective feedback from our users. Overall, users find
the framework more efficient for proofreading, understanding evolving graphs,
and sharing error correction strategies."
A Novel Falling-Ball Algorithm for Image Segmentation,"Image segmentation refers to the separation of objects from the background,
and has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.
Practically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%
accuracy, and therefore numerous segmentation techniques have been proposed in
the literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel
Falling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation
algorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall
model). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a
ball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment
basins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment
basin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic. Edges are constructed by
dividing image into different catchment basins with the help of a membership
function. Finally closed contour algorithm is applied to find closed regions
and objects within closed regions are segmented using intensity information.
The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated both objectively as well
as subjectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms gives
superior performance over conventional Sobel edge detection methods and the
watershed segmentation algorithm. For comparative analysis, various comparison
methods are used for demonstrating the superiority of proposed methods over
existing segmentation methods."
A Large-Scale Benchmark for Food Image Segmentation,"Food image segmentation is a critical and indispensible task for developing
health-related applications such as estimating food calories and nutrients.
Existing food image segmentation models are underperforming due to two reasons:
(1) there is a lack of high quality food image datasets with fine-grained
ingredient labels and pixel-wise location masks -- the existing datasets either
carry coarse ingredient labels or are small in size; and (2) the complex
appearance of food makes it difficult to localize and recognize ingredients in
food images, e.g., the ingredients may overlap one another in the same image,
and the identical ingredient may appear distinctly in different food images. In
this work, we build a new food image dataset FoodSeg103 (and its extension
FoodSeg154) containing 9,490 images. We annotate these images with 154
ingredient classes and each image has an average of 6 ingredient labels and
pixel-wise masks. In addition, we propose a multi-modality pre-training
approach called ReLeM that explicitly equips a segmentation model with rich and
semantic food knowledge. In experiments, we use three popular semantic
segmentation methods (i.e., Dilated Convolution based, Feature Pyramid based,
and Vision Transformer based) as baselines, and evaluate them as well as ReLeM
on our new datasets. We believe that the FoodSeg103 (and its extension
FoodSeg154) and the pre-trained models using ReLeM can serve as a benchmark to
facilitate future works on fine-grained food image understanding. We make all
these datasets and methods public at
\url{https://xiongweiwu.github.io/foodseg103.html}."
Boundary-Aware Segmentation Network for Mobile and Web Applications,"Although deep models have greatly improved the accuracy and robustness of
image segmentation, obtaining segmentation results with highly accurate
boundaries and fine structures is still a challenging problem. In this paper,
we propose a simple yet powerful Boundary-Aware Segmentation Network (BASNet),
which comprises a predict-refine architecture and a hybrid loss, for highly
accurate image segmentation. The predict-refine architecture consists of a
densely supervised encoder-decoder network and a residual refinement module,
which are respectively used to predict and refine a segmentation probability
map. The hybrid loss is a combination of the binary cross entropy, structural
similarity and intersection-over-union losses, which guide the network to learn
three-level (ie, pixel-, patch- and map- level) hierarchy representations. We
evaluate our BASNet on two reverse tasks including salient object segmentation,
camouflaged object segmentation, showing that it achieves very competitive
performance with sharp segmentation boundaries. Importantly, BASNet runs at
over 70 fps on a single GPU which benefits many potential real applications.
Based on BASNet, we further developed two (close to) commercial applications:
AR COPY & PASTE, in which BASNet is integrated with augmented reality for
""COPYING"" and ""PASTING"" real-world objects, and OBJECT CUT, which is a
web-based tool for automatic object background removal. Both applications have
already drawn huge amount of attention and have important real-world impacts.
The code and two applications will be publicly available at:
https://github.com/NathanUA/BASNet."
Auxiliary Learning by Implicit Differentiation,"Training neural networks with auxiliary tasks is a common practice for
improving the performance on a main task of interest. Two main challenges arise
in this multi-task learning setting: (i) designing useful auxiliary tasks; and
(ii) combining auxiliary tasks into a single coherent loss. Here, we propose a
novel framework, AuxiLearn, that targets both challenges based on implicit
differentiation. First, when useful auxiliaries are known, we propose learning
a network that combines all losses into a single coherent objective function.
This network can learn non-linear interactions between tasks. Second, when no
useful auxiliary task is known, we describe how to learn a network that
generates a meaningful, novel auxiliary task. We evaluate AuxiLearn in a series
of tasks and domains, including image segmentation and learning with attributes
in the low data regime, and find that it consistently outperforms competing
methods."
MDA-Net: Multi-Dimensional Attention-Based Neural Network for 3D Image Segmentation,"Segmenting an entire 3D image often has high computational complexity and
requires large memory consumption; by contrast, performing volumetric
segmentation in a slice-by-slice manner is efficient but does not fully
leverage the 3D data. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-dimensional
attention network (MDA-Net) to efficiently integrate slice-wise, spatial, and
channel-wise attention into a U-Net based network, which results in high
segmentation accuracy with a low computational cost. We evaluate our model on
the MICCAI iSeg and IBSR datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate
consistent improvements over existing methods."
A Characteristic Function-based Algorithm for Geodesic Active Contours,"Active contour models have been widely used in image segmentation, and the
level set method (LSM) is the most popular approach for solving the models, via
implicitly representing the contour by a level set function. However, the LSM
suffers from high computational burden and numerical instability, requiring
additional regularization terms or re-initialization techniques. In this paper,
we use characteristic functions to implicitly represent the contours, propose a
new representation to the geodesic active contours and derive an efficient
algorithm termed as the iterative convolution-thresholding method (ICTM).
Compared to the LSM, the ICTM is simpler and much more efficient. In addition,
the ICTM enjoys most desired features of the level set-based methods. Extensive
experiments, on 2D synthetic, 2D ultrasound, 3D CT, and 3D MR images for
nodule, organ and lesion segmentation, demonstrate that the proposed method not
only obtains comparable or even better segmentation results (compared to the
LSM) but also achieves significant acceleration."
Geodesic Paths for Image Segmentation with Implicit Region-based Homogeneity Enhancement,"Minimal paths are regarded as a powerful and efficient tool for boundary
detection and image segmentation due to its global optimality and the
well-established numerical solutions such as fast marching method. In this
paper, we introduce a flexible interactive image segmentation model based on
the Eikonal partial differential equation (PDE) framework in conjunction with
region-based homogeneity enhancement. A key ingredient in the introduced model
is the construction of local geodesic metrics, which are capable of integrating
anisotropic and asymmetric edge features, implicit region-based homogeneity
features and/or curvature regularization. The incorporation of the region-based
homogeneity features into the metrics considered relies on an implicit
representation of these features, which is one of the contributions of this
work. Moreover, we also introduce a way to build simple closed contours as the
concatenation of two disjoint open curves. Experimental results prove that the
proposed model indeed outperforms state-of-the-art minimal paths-based image
segmentation approaches."
Impact of individual rater style on deep learning uncertainty in medical imaging segmentation,"While multiple studies have explored the relation between inter-rater
variability and deep learning model uncertainty in medical segmentation tasks,
little is known about the impact of individual rater style. This study
quantifies rater style in the form of bias and consistency and explores their
impacts when used to train deep learning models. Two multi-rater public
datasets were used, consisting of brain multiple sclerosis lesion and spinal
cord grey matter segmentation. On both datasets, results show a correlation
($R^2 = 0.60$ and $0.93$) between rater bias and deep learning uncertainty. The
impact of label fusion between raters' annotations on this relationship is also
explored, and we show that multi-center consensuses are more effective than
single-center consensuses to reduce uncertainty, since rater style is mostly
center-specific."
Bayesian Logistic Shape Model Inference: application to cochlea image segmentation,"Incorporating shape information is essential for the delineation of many
organs and anatomical structures in medical images. While previous work has
mainly focused on parametric spatial transformations applied on reference
template shapes, in this paper, we address the Bayesian inference of parametric
shape models for segmenting medical images with the objective to provide
interpretable results. The proposed framework defines a likelihood appearance
probability and a prior label probability based on a generic shape function
through a logistic function. A reference length parameter defined in the
sigmoid controls the trade-off between shape and appearance information. The
inference of shape parameters is performed within an Expectation-Maximisation
approach where a Gauss-Newton optimization stage allows to provide an
approximation of the posterior probability of shape parameters. This framework
is applied to the segmentation of cochlea structures from clinical CT images
constrained by a 10 parameter shape model. It is evaluated on three different
datasets, one of which includes more than 200 patient images. The results show
performances comparable to supervised methods and better than previously
proposed unsupervised ones. It also enables an analysis of parameter
distributions and the quantification of segmentation uncertainty including the
effect of the shape model."
Encoder Fusion Network with Co-Attention Embedding for Referring Image Segmentation,"Recently, referring image segmentation has aroused widespread interest.
Previous methods perform the multi-modal fusion between language and vision at
the decoding side of the network. And, linguistic feature interacts with visual
feature of each scale separately, which ignores the continuous guidance of
language to multi-scale visual features. In this work, we propose an encoder
fusion network (EFN), which transforms the visual encoder into a multi-modal
feature learning network, and uses language to refine the multi-modal features
progressively. Moreover, a co-attention mechanism is embedded in the EFN to
realize the parallel update of multi-modal features, which can promote the
consistent of the cross-modal information representation in the semantic space.
Finally, we propose a boundary enhancement module (BEM) to make the network pay
more attention to the fine structure. The experiment results on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance under different evaluation metrics without any post-processing."
Combining Supervised and Un-supervised Learning for Automatic Citrus Segmentation,"Citrus segmentation is a key step of automatic citrus picking. While most
current image segmentation approaches achieve good segmentation results by
pixel-wise segmentation, these supervised learning-based methods require a
large amount of annotated data, and do not consider the continuous temporal
changes of citrus position in real-world applications. In this paper, we first
train a simple CNN with a small number of labelled citrus images in a
supervised manner, which can roughly predict the citrus location from each
frame. Then, we extend a state-of-the-art unsupervised learning approach to
pre-learn the citrus's potential movements between frames from unlabelled
citrus's videos. To take advantages of both networks, we employ the multimodal
transformer to combine supervised learned static information and unsupervised
learned movement information. The experimental results show that combing both
network allows the prediction accuracy reached at 88.3$\%$ IOU and 93.6$\%$
precision, outperforming the original supervised baseline 1.2$\%$ and 2.4$\%$.
Compared with most of the existing citrus segmentation methods, our method uses
a small amount of supervised data and a large number of unsupervised data,
while learning the pixel level location information and the temporal
information of citrus changes to enhance the segmentation effect."
Computer vision for liquid samples in hospitals and medical labs using hierarchical image segmentation and relations prediction,"This work explores the use of computer vision for image segmentation and
classification of medical fluid samples in transparent containers (for example,
tubes, syringes, infusion bags). Handling fluids such as infusion fluids,
blood, and urine samples is a significant part of the work carried out in
medical labs and hospitals. The ability to accurately identify and segment the
liquids and the vessels that contain them from images can help in automating
such processes. Modern computer vision typically involves training deep neural
nets on large datasets of annotated images. This work presents a new dataset
containing 1,300 annotated images of medical samples involving vessels
containing liquids and solid material. The images are annotated with the type
of liquid (e.g., blood, urine), the phase of the material (e.g., liquid, solid,
foam, suspension), the type of vessel (e.g., syringe, tube, cup, infusion
bottle/bag), and the properties of the vessel (transparent, opaque). In
addition, vessel parts such as corks, labels, spikes, and valves are annotated.
Relations and hierarchies between vessels and materials are also annotated,
such as which vessel contains which material or which vessels are linked or
contain each other. Three neural networks are trained on the dataset: One
network learns to detect vessels, a second net detects the materials and parts
inside each vessel, and a third net identifies relationships and connectivity
between vessels."
A Generalized Asymmetric Dual-front Model for Active Contours and Image Segmentation,"The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a
powerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain
partitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the
evolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi
regions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the
geodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi
diagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric
quadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the
integration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving
contours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour
shortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away
from the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity
distributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image
segmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The
numerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed
dual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results."
Beyond pixel-wise supervision for segmentation: A few global shape descriptors might be surprisingly good!,"Standard losses for training deep segmentation networks could be seen as
individual classifications of pixels, instead of supervising the global shape
of the predicted segmentations. While effective, they require exact knowledge
of the label of each pixel in an image.
  This study investigates how effective global geometric shape descriptors
could be, when used on their own as segmentation losses for training deep
networks. Not only interesting theoretically, there exist deeper motivations to
posing segmentation problems as a reconstruction of shape descriptors:
Annotations to obtain approximations of low-order shape moments could be much
less cumbersome than their full-mask counterparts, and anatomical priors could
be readily encoded into invariant shape descriptions, which might alleviate the
annotation burden. Also, and most importantly, we hypothesize that, given a
task, certain shape descriptions might be invariant across image acquisition
protocols/modalities and subject populations, which might open interesting
research avenues for generalization in medical image segmentation.
  We introduce and formulate a few shape descriptors in the context of deep
segmentation, and evaluate their potential as standalone losses on two
different challenging tasks. Inspired by recent works in constrained
optimization for deep networks, we propose a way to use those descriptors to
supervise segmentation, without any pixel-level label. Very surprisingly, as
little as 4 descriptors values per class can approach the performance of a
segmentation mask with 65k individual discrete labels. We also found that shape
descriptors can be a valid way to encode anatomical priors about the task,
enabling to leverage expert knowledge without additional annotations. Our
implementation is publicly available and can be easily extended to other tasks
and descriptors: https://github.com/hkervadec/shape_descriptors"
CASSOD-Net: Cascaded and Separable Structures of Dilated Convolution for Embedded Vision Systems and Applications,"The field of view (FOV) of convolutional neural networks is highly related to
the accuracy of inference. Dilated convolutions are known as an effective
solution to the problems which require large FOVs. However, for general-purpose
hardware or dedicated hardware, it usually takes extra time to handle dilated
convolutions compared with standard convolutions. In this paper, we propose a
network module, Cascaded and Separable Structure of Dilated (CASSOD)
Convolution, and a special hardware system to handle the CASSOD networks
efficiently. A CASSOD-Net includes multiple cascaded $2 \times 2$ dilated
filters, which can be used to replace the traditional $3 \times 3$ dilated
filters without decreasing the accuracy of inference. Two example applications,
face detection and image segmentation, are tested with dilated convolutions and
the proposed CASSOD modules. The new network for face detection achieves higher
accuracy than the previous work with only 47% of filter weights in the dilated
convolution layers of the context module. Moreover, the proposed hardware
system can accelerate the computations of dilated convolutions, and it is 2.78
times faster than traditional hardware systems when the filter size is $3
\times 3$."
Distributional Gaussian Process Layers for Outlier Detection in Image Segmentation,"We propose a parameter efficient Bayesian layer for hierarchical
convolutional Gaussian Processes that incorporates Gaussian Processes operating
in Wasserstein-2 space to reliably propagate uncertainty. This directly
replaces convolving Gaussian Processes with a distance-preserving affine
operator on distributions. Our experiments on brain tissue-segmentation show
that the resulting architecture approaches the performance of well-established
deterministic segmentation algorithms (U-Net), which has never been achieved
with previous hierarchical Gaussian Processes. Moreover, by applying the same
segmentation model to out-of-distribution data (i.e., images with pathology
such as brain tumors), we show that our uncertainty estimates result in
out-of-distribution detection that outperforms the capabilities of previous
Bayesian networks and reconstruction-based approaches that learn normative
distributions."
Two stages for visual object tracking,"Siamese-based trackers have achived promising performance on visual object
tracking tasks. Most existing Siamese-based trackers contain two separate
branches for tracking, including classification branch and bounding box
regression branch. In addition, image segmentation provides an alternative way
to obetain the more accurate target region. In this paper, we propose a novel
tracker with two-stages: detection and segmentation. The detection stage is
capable of locating the target by Siamese networks. Then more accurate tracking
results are obtained by segmentation module given the coarse state estimation
in the first stage. We conduct experiments on four benchmarks. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art results, with the EAO of 52.6$\%$ on VOT2016,
51.3$\%$ on VOT2018, and 39.0$\%$ on VOT2019 datasets, respectively."
Every Annotation Counts: Multi-label Deep Supervision for Medical Image Segmentation,"Pixel-wise segmentation is one of the most data and annotation hungry tasks
in our field. Providing representative and accurate annotations is often
mission-critical especially for challenging medical applications. In this
paper, we propose a semi-weakly supervised segmentation algorithm to overcome
this barrier. Our approach is based on a new formulation of deep supervision
and student-teacher model and allows for easy integration of different
supervision signals. In contrast to previous work, we show that care has to be
taken how deep supervision is integrated in lower layers and we present
multi-label deep supervision as the most important secret ingredient for
success. With our novel training regime for segmentation that flexibly makes
use of images that are either fully labeled, marked with bounding boxes, just
global labels, or not at all, we are able to cut the requirement for expensive
labels by 94.22% - narrowing the gap to the best fully supervised baseline to
only 5% mean IoU. Our approach is validated by extensive experiments on retinal
fluid segmentation and we provide an in-depth analysis of the anticipated
effect each annotation type can have in boosting segmentation performance."
Rethinking BiSeNet For Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"BiSeNet has been proved to be a popular two-stream network for real-time
segmentation. However, its principle of adding an extra path to encode spatial
information is time-consuming, and the backbones borrowed from pretrained
tasks, e.g., image classification, may be inefficient for image segmentation
due to the deficiency of task-specific design. To handle these problems, we
propose a novel and efficient structure named Short-Term Dense Concatenate
network (STDC network) by removing structure redundancy. Specifically, we
gradually reduce the dimension of feature maps and use the aggregation of them
for image representation, which forms the basic module of STDC network. In the
decoder, we propose a Detail Aggregation module by integrating the learning of
spatial information into low-level layers in single-stream manner. Finally, the
low-level features and deep features are fused to predict the final
segmentation results. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by achieving promising trade-off
between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. On Cityscapes, we achieve
71.9% mIoU on the test set with a speed of 250.4 FPS on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti,
which is 45.2% faster than the latest methods, and achieve 76.8% mIoU with 97.0
FPS while inferring on higher resolution images."
Benefits of Linear Conditioning with Metadata for Image Segmentation,"Medical images are often accompanied by metadata describing the image
(vendor, acquisition parameters) and the patient (disease type or severity,
demographics, genomics). This metadata is usually disregarded by image
segmentation methods. In this work, we adapt a linear conditioning method
called FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation) for image segmentation tasks. This
FiLM adaptation enables integrating metadata into segmentation models for
better performance. We observed an average Dice score increase of 5.1% on
spinal cord tumor segmentation when incorporating the tumor type with FiLM. The
metadata modulates the segmentation process through low-cost affine
transformations applied on feature maps which can be included in any neural
network's architecture. Additionally, we assess the relevance of segmentation
FiLM layers for tackling common challenges in medical imaging: multi-class
training with missing segmentations, model adaptation to multiple tasks, and
training with a limited or unbalanced number of annotated data. Our results
demonstrated the following benefits of FiLM for segmentation: FiLMed U-Net was
robust to missing labels and reached higher Dice scores with few labels (up to
16.7%) compared to single-task U-Net. The code is open-source and available at
www.ivadomed.org."
MIDeepSeg: Minimally Interactive Segmentation of Unseen Objects from Medical Images Using Deep Learning,"Segmentation of organs or lesions from medical images plays an essential role
in many clinical applications such as diagnosis and treatment planning. Though
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved the state-of-the-art
performance for automatic segmentation, they are often limited by the lack of
clinically acceptable accuracy and robustness in complex cases. Therefore,
interactive segmentation is a practical alternative to these methods. However,
traditional interactive segmentation methods require a large amount of user
interactions, and recently proposed CNN-based interactive segmentation methods
are limited by poor performance on previously unseen objects. To solve these
problems, we propose a novel deep learning-based interactive segmentation
method that not only has high efficiency due to only requiring clicks as user
inputs but also generalizes well to a range of previously unseen objects.
Specifically, we first encode user-provided interior margin points via our
proposed exponentialized geodesic distance that enables a CNN to achieve a good
initial segmentation result of both previously seen and unseen objects, then we
use a novel information fusion method that combines the initial segmentation
with only few additional user clicks to efficiently obtain a refined
segmentation. We validated our proposed framework through extensive experiments
on 2D and 3D medical image segmentation tasks with a wide range of previous
unseen objects that were not present in the training set. Experimental results
showed that our proposed framework 1) achieves accurate results with fewer user
interactions and less time compared with state-of-the-art interactive
frameworks and 2) generalizes well to previously unseen objects."
Quantization of Deep Neural Networks for Accurate EdgeComputing,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their great potential in recent
years, exceeding the per-formance of human experts in a wide range of
applications. Due to their large sizes, however, compressiontechniques such as
weight quantization and pruning are usually applied before they can be
accommodated onthe edge. It is generally believed that quantization leads to
performance degradation, and plenty of existingworks have explored quantization
strategies aiming at minimum accuracy loss. In this paper, we argue
thatquantization, which essentially imposes regularization on weight
representations, can sometimes help toimprove accuracy. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on three widely used applications: fully con-nected
network (FCN) for biomedical image segmentation, convolutional neural network
(CNN) for imageclassification on ImageNet, and recurrent neural network (RNN)
for automatic speech recognition, and experi-mental results show that
quantization can improve the accuracy by 1%, 1.95%, 4.23% on the three
applicationsrespectively with 3.5x-6.4x memory reduction."
GENESIS-V2: Inferring Unordered Object Representations without Iterative Refinement,"Advances in object-centric generative models (OCGMs) have culminated in the
development of a broad range of methods for unsupervised object segmentation
and interpretable object-centric scene generation. These methods, however, are
limited to simulated and real-world datasets with limited visual complexity.
Moreover, object representations are often inferred using RNNs which do not
scale well to large images or iterative refinement which avoids imposing an
unnatural ordering on objects in an image but requires the a priori
initialisation of a fixed number of object representations. In contrast to
established paradigms, this work proposes an embedding-based approach in which
embeddings of pixels are clustered in a differentiable fashion using a
stochastic, non-parametric stick-breaking process. Similar to iterative
refinement, this clustering procedure also leads to randomly ordered object
representations, but without the need of initialising a fixed number of
clusters a priori. This is used to develop a new model, GENESIS-V2, which can
infer a variable number of object representations without using RNNs or
iterative refinement. We show that GENESIS-V2 outperforms previous methods for
unsupervised image segmentation and object-centric scene generation on
established synthetic datasets as well as more complex real-world datasets."
ObjectAug: Object-level Data Augmentation for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Semantic image segmentation aims to obtain object labels with precise
boundaries, which usually suffers from overfitting. Recently, various data
augmentation strategies like regional dropout and mix strategies have been
proposed to address the problem. These strategies have proved to be effective
for guiding the model to attend on less discriminative parts. However, current
strategies operate at the image level, and objects and the background are
coupled. Thus, the boundaries are not well augmented due to the fixed semantic
scenario. In this paper, we propose ObjectAug to perform object-level
augmentation for semantic image segmentation. ObjectAug first decouples the
image into individual objects and the background using the semantic labels.
Next, each object is augmented individually with commonly used augmentation
methods (e.g., scaling, shifting, and rotation). Then, the black area brought
by object augmentation is further restored using image inpainting. Finally, the
augmented objects and background are assembled as an augmented image. In this
way, the boundaries can be fully explored in the various semantic scenarios. In
addition, ObjectAug can support category-aware augmentation that gives various
possibilities to objects in each category, and can be easily combined with
existing image-level augmentation methods to further boost performance.
Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both natural image and medical image
datasets. Experiment results demonstrate that our ObjectAug can evidently
improve segmentation performance."
Flow-based Video Segmentation for Human Head and Shoulders,"Video segmentation for the human head and shoulders is essential in creating
elegant media for videoconferencing and virtual reality applications. The main
challenge is to process high-quality background subtraction in a real-time
manner and address the segmentation issues under motion blurs, e.g., shaking
the head or waving hands during conference video. To overcome the motion blur
problem in video segmentation, we propose a novel flow-based encoder-decoder
network (FUNet) that combines both traditional Horn-Schunck optical-flow
estimation technique and convolutional neural networks to perform robust
real-time video segmentation. We also introduce a video and image segmentation
dataset: ConferenceVideoSegmentationDataset. Code and pre-trained models are
available on our GitHub repository:
\url{https://github.com/kuangzijian/Flow-Based-Video-Matting}."
DatasetGAN: Efficient Labeled Data Factory with Minimal Human Effort,"We introduce DatasetGAN: an automatic procedure to generate massive datasets
of high-quality semantically segmented images requiring minimal human effort.
Current deep networks are extremely data-hungry, benefiting from training on
large-scale datasets, which are time consuming to annotate. Our method relies
on the power of recent GANs to generate realistic images. We show how the GAN
latent code can be decoded to produce a semantic segmentation of the image.
Training the decoder only needs a few labeled examples to generalize to the
rest of the latent space, resulting in an infinite annotated dataset generator!
These generated datasets can then be used for training any computer vision
architecture just as real datasets are. As only a few images need to be
manually segmented, it becomes possible to annotate images in extreme detail
and generate datasets with rich object and part segmentations. To showcase the
power of our approach, we generated datasets for 7 image segmentation tasks
which include pixel-level labels for 34 human face parts, and 32 car parts. Our
approach outperforms all semi-supervised baselines significantly and is on par
with fully supervised methods, which in some cases require as much as 100x more
annotated data as our method."
Interpretability-Driven Sample Selection Using Self Supervised Learning For Disease Classification And Segmentation,"In supervised learning for medical image analysis, sample selection
methodologies are fundamental to attain optimum system performance promptly and
with minimal expert interactions (e.g. label querying in an active learning
setup). In this paper we propose a novel sample selection methodology based on
deep features leveraging information contained in interpretability saliency
maps. In the absence of ground truth labels for informative samples, we use a
novel self supervised learning based approach for training a classifier that
learns to identify the most informative sample in a given batch of images. We
demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach, termed
Interpretability-Driven Sample Selection (IDEAL), in an active learning setup
aimed at lung disease classification and histopathology image segmentation. We
analyze three different approaches to determine sample informativeness from
interpretability saliency maps: (i) an observational model stemming from
findings on previous uncertainty-based sample selection approaches, (ii) a
radiomics-based model, and (iii) a novel data-driven self-supervised approach.
We compare IDEAL to other baselines using the publicly available NIH chest
X-ray dataset for lung disease classification, and a public histopathology
segmentation dataset (GLaS), demonstrating the potential of using
interpretability information for sample selection in active learning systems.
Results show our proposed self supervised approach outperforms other approaches
in selecting informative samples leading to state of the art performance with
fewer samples."
Semantic Segmentation with Generative Models: Semi-Supervised Learning and Strong Out-of-Domain Generalization,"Training deep networks with limited labeled data while achieving a strong
generalization ability is key in the quest to reduce human annotation efforts.
This is the goal of semi-supervised learning, which exploits more widely
available unlabeled data to complement small labeled data sets. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework for discriminative pixel-level tasks using a
generative model of both images and labels. Concretely, we learn a generative
adversarial network that captures the joint image-label distribution and is
trained efficiently using a large set of unlabeled images supplemented with
only few labeled ones. We build our architecture on top of StyleGAN2, augmented
with a label synthesis branch. Image labeling at test time is achieved by first
embedding the target image into the joint latent space via an encoder network
and test-time optimization, and then generating the label from the inferred
embedding. We evaluate our approach in two important domains: medical image
segmentation and part-based face segmentation. We demonstrate strong in-domain
performance compared to several baselines, and are the first to showcase
extreme out-of-domain generalization, such as transferring from CT to MRI in
medical imaging, and photographs of real faces to paintings, sculptures, and
even cartoons and animal faces. Project Page:

Spatially Varying Label Smoothing: Capturing Uncertainty from Expert Annotations,"The task of image segmentation is inherently noisy due to ambiguities
regarding the exact location of boundaries between anatomical structures. We
argue that this information can be extracted from the expert annotations at no
extra cost, and when integrated into state-of-the-art neural networks, it can
lead to improved calibration between soft probabilistic predictions and the
underlying uncertainty. We built upon label smoothing (LS) where a network is
trained on 'blurred' versions of the ground truth labels which has been shown
to be effective for calibrating output predictions. However, LS is not taking
the local structure into account and results in overly smoothed predictions
with low confidence even for non-ambiguous regions. Here, we propose Spatially
Varying Label Smoothing (SVLS), a soft labeling technique that captures the
structural uncertainty in semantic segmentation. SVLS also naturally lends
itself to incorporate inter-rater uncertainty when multiple labelmaps are
available. The proposed approach is extensively validated on four clinical
segmentation tasks with different imaging modalities, number of classes and
single and multi-rater expert annotations. The results demonstrate that SVLS,
despite its simplicity, obtains superior boundary prediction with improved
uncertainty and model calibration."
An MRF-UNet Product of Experts for Image Segmentation,"While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by back-propagation have
seen unprecedented success at semantic segmentation tasks, they are known to
struggle on out-of-distribution data. Markov random fields (MRFs) on the other
hand, encode simpler distributions over labels that, although less flexible
than UNets, are less prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose to fuse
both strategies by computing the product of distributions of a UNet and an MRF.
As this product is intractable, we solve for an approximate distribution using
an iterative mean-field approach. The resulting MRF-UNet is trained jointly by
back-propagation. Compared to other works using conditional random fields
(CRFs), the MRF has no dependency on the imaging data, which should allow for
less over-fitting. We show on 3D neuroimaging data that this novel network
improves generalisation to out-of-distribution samples. Furthermore, it allows
the overall number of parameters to be reduced while preserving high accuracy.
These results suggest that a classic MRF smoothness prior can allow for less
over-fitting when principally integrated into a CNN model. Our implementation
is available at https://github.com/balbasty/nitorch."
Constrained domain adaptation for Image segmentation,"We propose to adapt segmentation networks with a constrained formulation,
which embeds domain-invariant prior knowledge about the segmentation regions.
Such knowledge may take the form of simple anatomical information, e.g.,
structure size or shape, estimated from source samples or known a priori. Our
method imposes domain-invariant inequality constraints on the network outputs
of unlabeled target samples. It implicitly matches prediction statistics
between target and source domains with permitted uncertainty of prior
knowledge. We address our constrained problem with a differentiable penalty,
fully suited for standard stochastic gradient descent approaches, removing the
need for computationally expensive Lagrangian optimization with dual
projections. Unlike current two-step adversarial training, our formulation is
based on a single loss in a single network, which simplifies adaptation by
avoiding extra adversarial steps, while improving convergence and quality of
training.
  The comparison of our approach with state-of-the-art adversarial methods
reveals substantially better performance on the challenging task of adapting
spine segmentation across different MRI modalities. Our results also show a
robustness to imprecision of size priors, approaching the accuracy of a fully
supervised model trained directly in a target domain.Our method can be readily
used for various constraints and segmentation problems."
Ensemble Learning based on Classifier Prediction Confidence and Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimisation for polyp localisation,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the first cause of death in many countries. CRC
originates from a small clump of cells on the lining of the colon called
polyps, which over time might grow and become malignant. Early detection and
removal of polyps are therefore necessary for the prevention of colon cancer.
In this paper, we introduce an ensemble of medical polyp segmentation
algorithms. Based on an observation that different segmentation algorithms will
perform well on different subsets of examples because of the nature and size of
training sets they have been exposed to and because of method-intrinsic
factors, we propose to measure the confidence in the prediction of each
algorithm and then use an associate threshold to determine whether the
confidence is acceptable or not. An algorithm is selected for the ensemble if
the confidence is below its associate threshold. The optimal threshold for each
segmentation algorithm is found by using Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm
Optimization (CLPSO), a swarm intelligence algorithm. The Dice coefficient, a
popular performance metric for image segmentation, is used as the fitness
criteria. Experimental results on two polyp segmentation datasets MICCAI2015
and Kvasir-SEG confirm that our ensemble achieves better results compared to
some well-known segmentation algorithms."
Two layer Ensemble of Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Segmentation,"In recent years, deep learning has rapidly become a method of choice for the
segmentation of medical images. Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures such as
UNet have achieved state-of-the-art results on many medical datasets. To
further improve the performance in the segmentation task, we develop an
ensemble system which combines various deep learning architectures. We propose
a two-layer ensemble of deep learning models for the segmentation of medical
images. The prediction for each training image pixel made by each model in the
first layer is used as the augmented data of the training image for the second
layer of the ensemble. The prediction of the second layer is then combined by
using a weights-based scheme in which each model contributes differently to the
combined result. The weights are found by solving linear regression problems.
Experiments conducted on two popular medical datasets namely CAMUS and
Kvasir-SEG show that the proposed method achieves better results concerning two
performance metrics (Dice Coefficient and Hausdorff distance) compared to some
well-known benchmark algorithms."
Deep ensembles based on Stochastic Activation Selection for Polyp Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation has a wide array of applications ranging from
medical-image analysis, scene understanding, autonomous driving and robotic
navigation. This work deals with medical image segmentation and in particular
with accurate polyp detection and segmentation during colonoscopy examinations.
Several convolutional neural network architectures have been proposed to
effectively deal with this task and with the problem of segmenting objects at
different scale input. The basic architecture in image segmentation consists of
an encoder and a decoder: the first uses convolutional filters to extract
features from the image, the second is responsible for generating the final
output. In this work, we compare some variant of the DeepLab architecture
obtained by varying the decoder backbone. We compare several decoder
architectures, including ResNet, Xception, EfficentNet, MobileNet and we
perturb their layers by substituting ReLU activation layers with other
functions. The resulting methods are used to create deep ensembles which are
shown to be very effective. Our experimental evaluations show that our best
ensemble produces good segmentation results by achieving high evaluation scores
with a dice coefficient of 0.884, and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of
0.818 for the Kvasir-SEG dataset. To improve reproducibility and research
efficiency the MATLAB source code used for this research is available at
GitHub: https://github.com/LorisNanni."
Source-Relaxed Domain Adaptation for Image Segmentation,"Domain adaptation (DA) has drawn high interests for its capacity to adapt a
model trained on labeled source data to perform well on unlabeled or weakly
labeled target data from a different domain. Most common DA techniques require
the concurrent access to the input images of both the source and target
domains. However, in practice, it is common that the source images are not
available in the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in
medical imaging, for instance, when the source and target images come from
different clinical sites. We propose a novel formulation for adapting
segmentation networks, which relaxes such a constraint. Our formulation is
based on minimizing a label-free entropy loss defined over target-domain data,
which we further guide with a domain invariant prior on the segmentation
regions. Many priors can be used, derived from anatomical information. Here, a
class-ratio prior is learned via an auxiliary network and integrated in the
form of a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in our overall loss function. We
show the effectiveness of our prior-aware entropy minimization in adapting
spine segmentation across different MRI modalities. Our method yields
comparable results to several state-of-the-art adaptation techniques, even
though is has access to less information, the source images being absent in the
adaptation phase. Our straight-forward adaptation strategy only uses one
network, contrary to popular adversarial techniques, which cannot perform
without the presence of the source images. Our framework can be readily used
with various priors and segmentation problems."
Pneumothorax Segmentation: Deep Learning Image Segmentation to predict Pneumothorax,"Computer vision has shown promising results in medical image processing.
Pneumothorax is a deadly condition and if not diagnosed and treated at time
then it causes death. It can be diagnosed with chest X-ray images. We need an
expert and experienced radiologist to predict whether a person is suffering
from pneumothorax or not by looking at the chest X-ray images. Everyone does
not have access to such a facility. Moreover, in some cases, we need quick
diagnoses. So we propose an image segmentation model to predict and give the
output a mask that will assist the doctor in taking this crucial decision. Deep
Learning has proved their worth in many areas and outperformed man
state-of-the-art models. We want to use the power of these deep learning model
to solve this problem. We have used U-net [13] architecture with ResNet [17] as
a backbone and achieved promising results. U-net [13] performs very well in
medical image processing and semantic segmentation. Our problem falls in the
semantic segmentation category."
Deep Tiered Image Segmentation For Detecting Internal Ice Layers in Radar Imagery,"Understanding the structure of Earth's polar ice sheets is important for
modeling how global warming will impact polar ice and, in turn, the Earth's
climate. Ground-penetrating radar is able to collect observations of the
internal structure of snow and ice, but the process of manually labeling these
observations is slow and laborious. Recent work has developed automatic
techniques for finding the boundaries between the ice and the bedrock, but
finding internal layers - the subtle boundaries that indicate where one year's
ice accumulation ended and the next began - is much more challenging because
the number of layers varies and the boundaries often merge and split. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep neural network for solving a general class of
tiered segmentation problems. We then apply it to detecting internal layers in
polar ice, evaluating on a large-scale dataset of polar ice radar data with
human-labeled annotations as ground truth."
Hierarchical Image Peeling: A Flexible Scale-space Filtering Framework,"The importance of hierarchical image organization has been witnessed by a
wide spectrum of applications in computer vision and graphics. Different from
image segmentation with the spatial whole-part consideration, this work designs
a modern framework for disassembling an image into a family of derived signals
from a scale-space perspective. Specifically, we first offer a formal
definition of image disassembly. Then, by concerning desired properties, such
as peeling hierarchy and structure preservation, we convert the original
complex problem into a series of two-component separation sub-problems,
significantly reducing the complexity. The proposed framework is flexible to
both supervised and unsupervised settings. A compact recurrent network, namely
hierarchical image peeling net, is customized to efficiently and effectively
fulfill the task, which is about 3.5Mb in size, and can handle 1080p images in
more than 60 fps per recurrence on a GTX 2080Ti GPU, making it attractive for
practical use. Both theoretical findings and experimental results are provided
to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, reveal its superiority
over other state-of-the-art alternatives, and show its potential to various
applicable scenarios. Our code is available at
\url{https://github.com/ForawardStar/HIPe}."
Decomposing 3D Scenes into Objects via Unsupervised Volume Segmentation,"We present ObSuRF, a method which turns a single image of a scene into a 3D
model represented as a set of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), with each NeRF
corresponding to a different object. A single forward pass of an encoder
network outputs a set of latent vectors describing the objects in the scene.
These vectors are used independently to condition a NeRF decoder, defining the
geometry and appearance of each object. We make learning more computationally
efficient by deriving a novel loss, which allows training NeRFs on RGB-D inputs
without explicit ray marching. After confirming that the model performs equal
or better than state of the art on three 2D image segmentation benchmarks, we
apply it to two multi-object 3D datasets: A multiview version of CLEVR, and a
novel dataset in which scenes are populated by ShapeNet models. We find that
after training ObSuRF on RGB-D views of training scenes, it is capable of not
only recovering the 3D geometry of a scene depicted in a single input image,
but also to segment it into objects, despite receiving no supervision in that
regard."
Analysis of Information Flow Through U-Nets,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous in medical image
processing and analysis. Among them, U-Nets are very popular in various image
segmentation tasks. Yet, little is known about how information flows through
these networks and whether they are indeed properly designed for the tasks they
are being proposed for. In this paper, we employ information-theoretic tools in
order to gain insight into information flow through U-Nets. In particular, we
show how mutual information between input/output and an intermediate layer can
be a useful tool to understand information flow through various portions of a
U-Net, assess its architectural efficiency, and even propose more efficient
designs."
MeanShift++: Extremely Fast Mode-Seeking With Applications to Segmentation and Object Tracking,"MeanShift is a popular mode-seeking clustering algorithm used in a wide range
of applications in machine learning. However, it is known to be prohibitively
slow, with quadratic runtime per iteration. We propose MeanShift++, an
extremely fast mode-seeking algorithm based on MeanShift that uses a grid-based
approach to speed up the mean shift step, replacing the computationally
expensive neighbors search with a density-weighted mean of adjacent grid cells.
In addition, we show that this grid-based technique for density estimation
comes with theoretical guarantees. The runtime is linear in the number of
points and exponential in dimension, which makes MeanShift++ ideal on
low-dimensional applications such as image segmentation and object tracking. We
provide extensive experimental analysis showing that MeanShift++ can be more
than 10,000x faster than MeanShift with competitive clustering results on
benchmark datasets and nearly identical image segmentations as MeanShift.
Finally, we show promising results for object tracking."
FANet: A Feedback Attention Network for Improved Biomedical Image Segmentation,"With the increase in available large clinical and experimental datasets,
there has been substantial amount of work being done on addressing the
challenges in the area of biomedical image analysis. Image segmentation, which
is crucial for any quantitative analysis, has especially attracted attention.
Recent hardware advancement has led to the success of deep learning approaches.
However, although deep learning models are being trained on large datasets,
existing methods do not use the information from different learning epochs
effectively. In this work, we leverage the information of each training epoch
to prune the prediction maps of the subsequent epochs. We propose a novel
architecture called feedback attention network (FANet) that unifies the
previous epoch mask with the feature map of the current training epoch. The
previous epoch mask is then used to provide a hard attention to the learnt
feature maps at different convolutional layers. The network also allows to
rectify the predictions in an iterative fashion during the test time. We show
that our proposed feedback attention model provides a substantial improvement
on most segmentation metrics tested on seven publicly available biomedical
imaging datasets demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed FANet."
Polygonal Building Segmentation by Frame Field Learning,"While state of the art image segmentation models typically output
segmentations in raster format, applications in geographic information systems
often require vector polygons. To help bridge the gap between deep network
output and the format used in downstream tasks, we add a frame field output to
a deep segmentation model for extracting buildings from remote sensing images.
We train a deep neural network that aligns a predicted frame field to ground
truth contours. This additional objective improves segmentation quality by
leveraging multi-task learning and provides structural information that later
facilitates polygonization; we also introduce a polygonization algorithm that
utilizes the frame field along with the raster segmentation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Lydorn/Polygonization-by-Frame-Field-Learning."
Topology-Preserving 3D Image Segmentation Based On Hyperelastic Regularization,"Image segmentation is to extract meaningful objects from a given image. For
degraded images due to occlusions, obscurities or noises, the accuracy of the
segmentation result can be severely affected. To alleviate this problem, prior
information about the target object is usually introduced. In [10], a
topology-preserving registration-based segmentation model was proposed, which
is restricted to segment 2D images only. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
topology-preserving registration-based segmentation model with the hyperelastic
regularization, which can handle both 2D and 3D images. The existence of the
solution of the proposed model is established. We also propose a converging
iterative scheme to solve the proposed model. Numerical experiments have been
carried out on the synthetic and real images, which demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed model."
Task-agnostic Out-of-Distribution Detection Using Kernel Density Estimation,"In the recent years, researchers proposed a number of successful methods to
perform out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in deep neural networks (DNNs). So
far the scope of the highly accurate methods has been limited to image level
classification tasks. However, attempts for generally applicable methods beyond
classification did not attain similar performance. In this paper, we address
this limitation by proposing a simple yet effective task-agnostic OOD detection
method. We estimate the probability density functions (pdfs) of intermediate
features of a pre-trained DNN by performing kernel density estimation (KDE) on
the training dataset. As direct application of KDE to feature maps is hindered
by their high dimensionality, we use a set of lower-dimensional marginalized
KDE models instead of a single high-dimensional one. At test time, we evaluate
the pdfs on a test sample and produce a confidence score that indicates the
sample is OOD. The use of KDE eliminates the need for making simplifying
assumptions about the underlying feature pdfs and makes the proposed method
task-agnostic. We perform extensive experiments on classification tasks using
benchmark datasets for OOD detection. Additionally, we perform experiments on
medical image segmentation tasks using brain MRI datasets. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves high OOD detection
performance in both classification and segmentation tasks and improves
state-of-the-art in almost all cases. Code is available at
\url{https://github.com/eerdil/task_agnostic_ood}"
Boundary IoU: Improving Object-Centric Image Segmentation Evaluation,"We present Boundary IoU (Intersection-over-Union), a new segmentation
evaluation measure focused on boundary quality. We perform an extensive
analysis across different error types and object sizes and show that Boundary
IoU is significantly more sensitive than the standard Mask IoU measure to
boundary errors for large objects and does not over-penalize errors on smaller
objects. The new quality measure displays several desirable characteristics
like symmetry w.r.t. prediction/ground truth pairs and balanced responsiveness
across scales, which makes it more suitable for segmentation evaluation than
other boundary-focused measures like Trimap IoU and F-measure. Based on
Boundary IoU, we update the standard evaluation protocols for instance and
panoptic segmentation tasks by proposing the Boundary AP (Average Precision)
and Boundary PQ (Panoptic Quality) metrics, respectively. Our experiments show
that the new evaluation metrics track boundary quality improvements that are
generally overlooked by current Mask IoU-based evaluation metrics. We hope that
the adoption of the new boundary-sensitive evaluation metrics will lead to
rapid progress in segmentation methods that improve boundary quality."
Locate then Segment: A Strong Pipeline for Referring Image Segmentation,"Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a
natural language expression. Previous methods usually focus on designing an
implicit and recurrent feature interaction mechanism to fuse the
visual-linguistic features to directly generate the final segmentation mask
without explicitly modeling the localization information of the referent
instances. To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective
by decoupling it into a ""Locate-Then-Segment"" (LTS) scheme. Given a language
expression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding
target image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object
based on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual
features to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model
interaction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with
position prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a
light-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly
effective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the
previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+
and +3.4% on RefCOCOg). In addition, our model is more interpretable with
explicitly locating the object, which is also proved by visualization
experiments. We believe this framework is promising to serve as a strong
baseline for referring image segmentation."
Is segmentation uncertainty useful?,"Probabilistic image segmentation encodes varying prediction confidence and
inherent ambiguity in the segmentation problem. While different probabilistic
segmentation models are designed to capture different aspects of segmentation
uncertainty and ambiguity, these modelling differences are rarely discussed in
the context of applications of uncertainty. We consider two common use cases of
segmentation uncertainty, namely assessment of segmentation quality and active
learning. We consider four established strategies for probabilistic
segmentation, discuss their modelling capabilities, and investigate their
performance in these two tasks. We find that for all models and both tasks,
returned uncertainty correlates positively with segmentation error, but does
not prove to be useful for active learning."
Self-Guided and Cross-Guided Learning for Few-Shot Segmentation,"Few-shot segmentation has been attracting a lot of attention due to its
effectiveness to segment unseen object classes with a few annotated samples.
Most existing approaches use masked Global Average Pooling (GAP) to encode an
annotated support image to a feature vector to facilitate query image
segmentation. However, this pipeline unavoidably loses some discriminative
information due to the average operation. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective self-guided learning approach, where the lost critical
information is mined. Specifically, through making an initial prediction for
the annotated support image, the covered and uncovered foreground regions are
encoded to the primary and auxiliary support vectors using masked GAP,
respectively. By aggregating both primary and auxiliary support vectors, better
segmentation performances are obtained on query images. Enlightened by our
self-guided module for 1-shot segmentation, we propose a cross-guided module
for multiple shot segmentation, where the final mask is fused using predictions
from multiple annotated samples with high-quality support vectors contributing
more and vice versa. This module improves the final prediction in the inference
stage without re-training. Extensive experiments show that our approach
achieves new state-of-the-art performances on both PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
datasets."
DiNTS: Differentiable Neural Network Topology Search for 3D Medical Image Segmentation,"Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) has been applied to automatically
search high-performance networks for medical image segmentation. The NAS search
space usually contains a network topology level (controlling connections among
cells with different spatial scales) and a cell level (operations within each
cell). Existing methods either require long searching time for large-scale 3D
image datasets, or are limited to pre-defined topologies (such as U-shaped or
single-path). In this work, we focus on three important aspects of NAS in 3D
medical image segmentation: flexible multi-path network topology, high search
efficiency, and budgeted GPU memory usage. A novel differentiable search
framework is proposed to support fast gradient-based search within a highly
flexible network topology search space. The discretization of the searched
optimal continuous model in differentiable scheme may produce a sub-optimal
final discrete model (discretization gap). Therefore, we propose a topology
loss to alleviate this problem. In addition, the GPU memory usage for the
searched 3D model is limited with budget constraints during search. Our
Differentiable Network Topology Search scheme (DiNTS) is evaluated on the
Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, which contains ten challenging

Generic Attention-model Explainability for Interpreting Bi-Modal and Encoder-Decoder Transformers,"Transformers are increasingly dominating multi-modal reasoning tasks, such as
visual question answering, achieving state-of-the-art results thanks to their
ability to contextualize information using the self-attention and co-attention
mechanisms. These attention modules also play a role in other computer vision
tasks including object detection and image segmentation. Unlike Transformers
that only use self-attention, Transformers with co-attention require to
consider multiple attention maps in parallel in order to highlight the
information that is relevant to the prediction in the model's input. In this
work, we propose the first method to explain prediction by any
Transformer-based architecture, including bi-modal Transformers and
Transformers with co-attentions. We provide generic solutions and apply these
to the three most commonly used of these architectures: (i) pure
self-attention, (ii) self-attention combined with co-attention, and (iii)
encoder-decoder attention. We show that our method is superior to all existing
methods which are adapted from single modality explainability."
DCNAS: Densely Connected Neural Architecture Search for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown great potentials in automatically
designing scalable network architectures for dense image predictions. However,
existing NAS algorithms usually compromise on restricted search space and
search on proxy task to meet the achievable computational demands. To allow as
wide as possible network architectures and avoid the gap between target and
proxy dataset, we propose a Densely Connected NAS (DCNAS) framework, which
directly searches the optimal network structures for the multi-scale
representations of visual information, over a large-scale target dataset.
Specifically, by connecting cells with each other using learnable weights, we
introduce a densely connected search space to cover an abundance of mainstream
network designs. Moreover, by combining both path-level and channel-level
sampling strategies, we design a fusion module to reduce the memory consumption
of ample search space. We demonstrate that the architecture obtained from our
DCNAS algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performances on public semantic image
segmentation benchmarks, including 84.3% on Cityscapes, and 86.9% on PASCAL VOC
2012. We also retain leading performances when evaluating the architecture on
the more challenging ADE20K and Pascal Context dataset."
